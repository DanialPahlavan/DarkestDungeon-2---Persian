affinity_change_bark_add_guard_participating_dd+plague_doctor=Bodies can be mended!
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_participating_dd+occultist=Fate has other things in store for you.
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_participating_dd+jester=Allow me to draw their ire.
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_participating_dd+leper=Death is not to be feared, but let us not hurry it.
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_participating_dd+hellion=Hold fast - I am your armour!
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_participating_dd+runaway=Get up, damn you! You're not done!

affinity_change_bark_add_guard_participating_wounded+runaway=I won't let 'em catch you!
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_participating_wounded+vestal=Take shelter behind me.
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_participating_wounded+flagellant=Death shall be no master over you!

affinity_change_bark_add_token_participating+runaway=See? I ain't all bad.
affinity_change_bark_add_token_participating+vestal=There is strength in you. Find it.
affinity_change_bark_add_token_participating+flagellant=A glimpse of the power my pain has bought.
affinity_change_bark_follow_up_hit=We're beating them back!
affinity_change_bark_follow_up_hit=As one!

affinity_change_bark_follow_up_hit_comboedtarget+grave_robber=Brilliant!
affinity_change_bark_follow_up_hit_comboedtarget+plague_doctor=We weary them!
affinity_change_bark_follow_up_hit_comboedtarget+occultist=They'll be feeling that one.
affinity_change_bark_follow_up_hit_comboedtarget+jester=I trained as a soloist, but...
affinity_change_bark_follow_up_hit_comboedtarget+leper=Many are the hands that dig their graves.
affinity_change_bark_follow_up_hit_comboedtarget+hellion=STRIKE WHERE THEY ALREADY BLEED!
affinity_change_bark_follow_up_hit_comboedtarget+runaway=Hah! Not so fast!
affinity_change_bark_follow_up_hit_comboedtarget+vestal=Light, steer our blades true!
affinity_change_bark_follow_up_hit_comboedtarget+flagellant=Stray not - our burden is divine!

affinity_change_bark_follow_up_hit_crittedtarget=Hah!
affinity_change_bark_follow_up_hit_crittedtarget+highwayman=I line 'em up...

affinity_change_bark_follow_up_hit_crittedtarget+hellion=GRAAAAAH!
affinity_change_bark_follow_up_hit_crittedtarget+runaway=Don't let a single one flee!
affinity_change_bark_follow_up_hit_crittedtarget+vestal=They fear the glare of our torch!
affinity_change_bark_follow_up_hit_crittedtarget+flagellant=Through their flesh, our path to divinity!
affinity_change_bark_follow_up_hit_debuffedtarget=They'll be scared of US soon!
affinity_change_bark_follow_up_hit_debuffedtarget=Cut them down to size!
affinity_change_bark_follow_up_hit_debuffedtarget+highwayman=Now we're fightin' dirty!
affinity_change_bark_follow_up_hit_debuffedtarget+man_at_arms=Now! On the offensive!
affinity_change_bark_follow_up_hit_debuffedtarget+grave_robber=Hammer on the nail, you are.
affinity_change_bark_follow_up_hit_debuffedtarget+plague_doctor=They are enfeebled! Now!

affinity_change_bark_follow_up_hit_debuffedtarget+hellion=Never saw you coming!
affinity_change_bark_follow_up_hit_debuffedtarget+runaway=Yes! Now, again!
affinity_change_bark_follow_up_hit_debuffedtarget+vestal=Banish them!
affinity_change_bark_follow_up_hit_debuffedtarget+flagellant=They shrivel in the face of my purity!
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating=Back in the fray with you!
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating=You'll survive this!
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating+highwayman=What's a little blood, eh.
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating+man_at_arms=On you go!
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating+grave_robber=There. Good as gold.
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating+plague_doctor=Cease your wriggling and let me work!
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating+occultist=Allow me.
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating+jester=I'll fix that if you stop bleeding on me.
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating+leper=This pain of yours - it has a purpose.
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating+hellion=You will spill more blood yet!
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating+runaway=Lemme get that.
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating+vestal=Close your eyes a moment, friend.
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating+flagellant=Every wound a doorway to the divine.

affinity_change_bark_healing_participating_dd+man_at_arms=On your feet!
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating_dd+grave_robber=You're of great use to us. Not yet.
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating_dd+plague_doctor=I conquered death once - I can do so again!
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating_dd+occultist=It is not your time.
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating_dd+jester=You can't leave me short-handed.
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating_dd+leper=Our journey has not reached its end.
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating_dd+hellion=A weakling you are not!
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating_dd+runaway=You're no quitter!
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating_dd+vestal=Trust in the Light and each other.
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating_dd+flagellant=Make an offering of this flesh. Purify yourself!
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating_wounded=You're still in this fight, friend!
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating_wounded=That one looks deep.
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating_wounded+highwayman=Can't leave you hangin', can I?
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating_wounded+man_at_arms=What are comrades for?
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating_wounded+grave_robber=T'ain't pretty, but it will hold.
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating_wounded+plague_doctor=None better for your wounds than I!
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating_wounded+occultist=This may hurt.
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating_wounded+jester=We'll fix it up proper on the coach later.
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating_wounded+leper=You take punishment well.
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating_wounded+hellion=We look after one another!
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating_wounded+runaway=Can't have you flagging!
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating_wounded+vestal=Let me read you a verse...
affinity_change_bark_healing_participating_wounded+flagellant=Seek absolution and ye shall find.
affinity_change_bark_revenge_from_hit=You aren't so bad.

affinity_change_bark_revenge_from_hit+plague_doctor=Skill and coordination!
affinity_change_bark_revenge_from_hit+occultist=Were you using me as bait? Hah.
affinity_change_bark_revenge_from_hit+jester=That'll do!
affinity_change_bark_revenge_from_hit+leper=It is a blessing to fight alone no longer.
affinity_change_bark_revenge_from_hit+hellion=We will best them as one!
affinity_change_bark_revenge_from_hit+runaway=Phew, that'll show 'em.
affinity_change_bark_revenge_from_hit+vestal=Light, smile upon this one.
affinity_change_bark_revenge_from_hit+flagellant=Ensure that I bled for purpose!
affinity_change_bark_revenge_from_crit=They'll be sorry!

affinity_change_bark_revenge_from_crit+occultist=Deepest thanks.
affinity_change_bark_revenge_from_crit+jester=I'm touched. 
affinity_change_bark_revenge_from_crit+leper=Even a worm will turn - and you are no worm.
affinity_change_bark_revenge_from_crit+hellion=Smell that! The wind turns! 
affinity_change_bark_revenge_from_crit+runaway=I wouldn't ask that of you... but thanks.
affinity_change_bark_revenge_from_crit+vestal=Only together do we stand a chance!
affinity_change_bark_revenge_from_crit+flagellant=The curs hunger for my sacred blood!
affinity_change_bark_moved_me_positive=This way to victory!
affinity_change_bark_moved_me_positive=Pardon, friend.
affinity_change_bark_moved_me_positive+highwayman=A good ambush is all preparation.
affinity_change_bark_moved_me_positive+man_at_arms=Positions, all! Form up!
affinity_change_bark_moved_me_positive+grave_robber=Let me slip past, hm?
affinity_change_bark_moved_me_positive+plague_doctor=I have an idea!
affinity_change_bark_moved_me_positive+occultist=This position may prove an advantage.
affinity_change_bark_moved_me_positive+jester=And a one and a two...
affinity_change_bark_moved_me_positive+leper=I am needed here.
affinity_change_bark_moved_me_positive+hellion=We can rush them from anywhere!

affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating=For your agonies.
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating=That looks sore.
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating=Wither not!
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating+highwayman=Pay me back later, eh?
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating+man_at_arms=That ought to do it!
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating+grave_robber=You're in fine hands - promise.
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating+plague_doctor=I'm sure I have an ampoule for that...

affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating_dd=Return to us!
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating_dd=Clamber back from the precipice!
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating_dd+highwayman=Bite down on somethin'. This might hurt.
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating_dd+man_at_arms=You ain't dismissed yet!
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating_dd+grave_robber=I'm no physic, but let me try!
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating_dd+plague_doctor=Move not an inch! I'm working!
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating_dd+occultist=Thought we'd lost you.
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating_dd+jester=Cuttin' it close, friend.
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating_dd+leper=Playing dice with fortune herself.
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating_dd+hellion=Is it not freeing, standing on the edge?!
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating_dd+runaway=Don't scare us like that.
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating_dd+vestal=Even dire wounds can be mended.
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating_dd+flagellant=You dance on the threshold - here lies power!
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating_wounded=No! I will not allow this!
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating_wounded=The pain persists, but you'll live!
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating_wounded+highwayman=That looks nasty. Here.
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating_wounded+man_at_arms=Mind your wounds!
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating_wounded+grave_robber=Here, lest ye grow faint.
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating_wounded+plague_doctor=We caught this in time. Here!
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating_wounded+occultist=Don't let that run rampant.
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating_wounded+jester=Fine. From my stash.
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating_wounded+leper=Wise not to let this fester.
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating_wounded+hellion=Foul spirits! Miasma in the air!
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating_wounded+runaway=That could spread. Let me.
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating_wounded+vestal=You require aid - I provide it.
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_participating_wounded+flagellant=Shrink ye not from what greatness asks!
affinity_change_bark_stress_heal_participating=There will be time for grief later.

affinity_change_bark_stress_heal_participating_stressed+hellion=Oust the fear from your heart!
affinity_change_bark_stress_heal_participating_stressed+runaway=Hold on - just a little longer.
affinity_change_bark_stress_heal_participating_stressed+vestal=I see the good in you.
affinity_change_bark_stress_heal_participating_stressed+flagellant=Sip of my blood and know peace.
affinity_change_bark_add_buff_observing_jealous=Forgotten in my hour of need.
affinity_change_bark_add_buff_observing_jealous=Clearly I've no part in your plan.
affinity_change_bark_add_buff_observing_jealous+highwayman=I see how it is.
affinity_change_bark_add_buff_observing_jealous+man_at_arms=Tactically unwise!
affinity_change_bark_add_buff_observing_jealous+grave_robber=Hmph! Suit yourself.
affinity_change_bark_add_buff_observing_jealous+plague_doctor=By my calculations, you misjudged that.
affinity_change_bark_add_buff_observing_jealous+occultist=You may live to regret that.
affinity_change_bark_add_buff_observing_jealous+jester=Am I a joke to you?
affinity_change_bark_add_buff_observing_jealous+leper=Swift to aid the others...
affinity_change_bark_add_buff_observing_jealous+hellion=Soft-skull!
affinity_change_bark_add_buff_observing_jealous+runaway=Nobody listens to me anyway.
affinity_change_bark_add_buff_observing_jealous+vestal=Think yourself so wise, hm?
affinity_change_bark_add_buff_observing_jealous+flagellant=You lack clarity and vision!
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_jealous_wounded=I see that I must get by without your help.
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_jealous_wounded=You see me suffer and do nothing...!
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_jealous_wounded+highwayman=No aid over here?
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_jealous_wounded+man_at_arms=You deploy our strength unwisely!
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_jealous_wounded+grave_robber=I shall continue on bleeding, I suppose.
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_jealous_wounded+plague_doctor=Inefficient!
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_jealous_wounded+occultist=A fell omen, that.
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_jealous_wounded+jester=Did I tick you off somehow?
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_jealous_wounded+leper=*quiet grumble*
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_jealous_wounded+hellion=I cannot fight if you let me die!
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_jealous_wounded+runaway=Good thing I expected no better.
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_jealous_wounded+vestal=I surely have greater need!
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_jealous_wounded+flagellant=Only I decide when I bleed!
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_mortally_jealous=I sit on the brink - and for what?
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_mortally_jealous=If this be the end, you'll regret it.
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_mortally_jealous+highwayman=Mistake it was, counting on you.
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_mortally_jealous+man_at_arms=If we lose this day, it's at your feet!
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_mortally_jealous+grave_robber=I deserved better.
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_mortally_jealous+plague_doctor=If I bleed out, who will staunch <i>your</i> wounds?
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_mortally_jealous+occultist=You would make a sacrifice of me? I see.
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_mortally_jealous+jester=I'll carry on alone, thanks.
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_mortally_jealous+leper=You sentence me to death.
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_mortally_jealous+hellion=Buffoon!
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_mortally_jealous+runaway=What am I worth to you?!
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_mortally_jealous+vestal=If I expire, you shall rue the day.
affinity_change_bark_add_guard_mortally_jealous+flagellant=You would let my suffering go to waste?!
affinity_change_bark_add_token_observing_jealous=Am I of no use...?
affinity_change_bark_add_token_observing_jealous=All this talk of teamwork...
affinity_change_bark_add_token_observing_jealous=Forgot about me?
affinity_change_bark_add_token_observing_jealous=Overlooked once again.
affinity_change_bark_add_token_observing_jealous+highwayman=Trust me so little, do you?
affinity_change_bark_add_token_observing_jealous+man_at_arms=You wouldn't know good leadership!
affinity_change_bark_add_token_observing_jealous+grave_robber=I shall make do without.
affinity_change_bark_add_token_observing_jealous+plague_doctor=Reckless!
affinity_change_bark_add_token_observing_jealous+occultist=You fear my strength.
affinity_change_bark_add_token_observing_jealous+jester=We'll see who's laughing when <i>you</i> need help!
affinity_change_bark_add_token_observing_jealous+leper=The jackal stalks alone.
affinity_change_bark_add_token_observing_jealous+hellion=Jealous of me, are you?!
affinity_change_bark_add_token_observing_jealous+runaway=Fine! I don't need you!
affinity_change_bark_add_token_observing_jealous+vestal=It's as though you wish me weak.
affinity_change_bark_add_token_observing_jealous+flagellant=Your heart cowers from me! I see the truth!
affinity_change_bark_feed_jealous=You gorge yourself on food that should be MINE!
affinity_change_bark_feed_jealous=Get your paws off <i>my feast!</i>
affinity_change_bark_feed_jealous=That banquet is not for you!
affinity_change_bark_feed_jealous=A delectable gift from the gods, but for ME!
affinity_change_bark_feed_jealous+highwayman=You have no idea how I've starved...
affinity_change_bark_feed_jealous+man_at_arms=I require that! For my strength!
affinity_change_bark_feed_jealous+grave_robber=And I thought I was a glutton.
affinity_change_bark_feed_jealous+plague_doctor=I require nourishment!
affinity_change_bark_feed_jealous+occultist=I have hunger beyond your ken.
affinity_change_bark_feed_jealous+jester=You don't get to take this from me!
affinity_change_bark_feed_jealous+leper=My constitution wanes...
affinity_change_bark_feed_jealous+hellion=I'll sever your greedy hands!
affinity_change_bark_feed_jealous+runaway=Don't leave me your damned scraps!
affinity_change_bark_feed_jealous+vestal=This feast is a blessing, you selfish lout!
affinity_change_bark_feed_jealous+flagellant=How I've bled, and you'd STARVE me...!
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_jealous=And what of <i>my</i> needs?
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_jealous=Are my wounds not enough?
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_jealous+highwayman=You think me unworthy?
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_jealous+man_at_arms=You never did hold any respect fer me.
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_jealous+grave_robber=Discard my trust to the midden, would ye?
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_jealous+plague_doctor=You leave your own medic to suffer!
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_jealous+occultist=I am slow to anger, but...
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_jealous+jester=I mistook you.
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_jealous+leper=*shakes head*
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_jealous+hellion=FORSAKEN!
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_jealous+runaway=That was your last chance!
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_jealous+vestal=You spurn me in my time of need!
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_jealous+flagellant=You see not the greater path before us!
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_jealous_wounded=Do you not see the bloodstains?!
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_jealous_wounded=How dare you!
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_jealous_wounded+highwayman=Written me off so soon?
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_jealous_wounded+man_at_arms=Our campaign shall bear the cost of this foolishness!
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_jealous_wounded+grave_robber=No help coming from you, I see.
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_jealous_wounded+plague_doctor=Your eyes must be afflicted!
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_jealous_wounded+occultist=A traitor in our midst, perhaps.
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_jealous_wounded+jester=You'll see no aid from me, either.
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_jealous_wounded+leper=To do nothing is to make a statement.
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_jealous_wounded+hellion=You aid our enemies by ignoring me!
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_jealous_wounded+runaway=... I thought you were different.
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_jealous_wounded+vestal=Repaid for my loyalty with <i>this?</i>
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_jealous_wounded+flagellant=You think me blighted, beyond hope!
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_mortally_jealous=Have I failed you somehow?
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_mortally_jealous=Alone at the end...
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_mortally_jealous+highwayman=Never trusted you a whit.
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_mortally_jealous+man_at_arms=Leave the sick an' the old behind, is it?
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_mortally_jealous+grave_robber=I'm not enough, then? So be it.
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_mortally_jealous+plague_doctor=A poor distribution of aid!
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_mortally_jealous+occultist=Toying with our fates, I see.
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_mortally_jealous+jester=I'll carry on bleeding, then.
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_mortally_jealous+leper=The king on his side upon the board...
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_mortally_jealous+hellion=ROT, THEN!
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_mortally_jealous+runaway=My gut told me right about you.
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_mortally_jealous+vestal=Who will pray for you when I am gone?
affinity_change_bark_healing_observing_mortally_jealous+flagellant=My consecrated flesh! My calling! Damn you!
affinity_change_bark_moved_me_negative=You trample in the line of fire!
affinity_change_bark_moved_me_negative=Pardon me?
affinity_change_bark_moved_me_negative+highwayman=I was lining up a shot!
affinity_change_bark_moved_me_negative+man_at_arms=You're out of formation!
affinity_change_bark_moved_me_negative+grave_robber=You oaf! They'll spy me now!
affinity_change_bark_moved_me_negative+plague_doctor=What is the meaning of this?!
affinity_change_bark_moved_me_negative+occultist=You presume much.
affinity_change_bark_moved_me_negative+jester=What's the matter - don't trust me?
affinity_change_bark_moved_me_negative+leper=I know where I am most useful.
affinity_change_bark_moved_me_negative+hellion=You have not earned the right!
affinity_change_bark_moved_me_negative+runaway=I don't recall takin' orders from you.
affinity_change_bark_moved_me_negative+vestal=Cease this nervous skittering!
affinity_change_bark_moved_me_negative+flagellant=Meddle not with my destiny! Away!
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_jealous=That ought to have been mine!
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_jealous=My trusted ally, indeed...
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_jealous+highwayman=Share the wealth, eh?
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_jealous+man_at_arms=I 'ad use for that!
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_jealous+grave_robber=Wherever are your manners?
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_jealous+plague_doctor=Cease these nonsense speculations!
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_jealous+occultist=Test fate at your own risk.
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_jealous+jester=Think me useless, do you?
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_jealous+leper=I require aid same as any hale soldier.
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_jealous+hellion=Don't let me grow weak...!
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_jealous+runaway=I ought to leave you in the dust...
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_jealous+vestal=By risking me you imperil us all!
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_jealous+flagellant=My blood alone is worth two of them! 
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_jealous_wounded=As I waste away...!
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_jealous_wounded=Showing your true colours, there.
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_jealous_wounded+highwayman=Not the first time I've been left bleeding.
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_jealous_wounded+man_at_arms=A unit is only as strong as its weakest arm...
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_jealous_wounded+grave_robber=Left to my own devices once more!
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_jealous_wounded+plague_doctor=You FOOL!
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_jealous_wounded+occultist=I have a long memory...
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_jealous_wounded+jester=I'll sort myself out, then.
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_jealous_wounded+leper=Hmph.
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_jealous_wounded+hellion=Who shall hold the line, then?!
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_jealous_wounded+runaway=Thought you had my back.
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_jealous_wounded+vestal=At any moment they shall break us!
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_jealous_wounded+flagellant=You play at strategy like a child with toys.
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_mortally_jealous=While I breathe my last...?
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_mortally_jealous=Here I suffer, unaided...
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_mortally_jealous+highwayman=Fine. Leave me to the fate I deserve...
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_mortally_jealous+man_at_arms=I see my trust was misplaced.
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_mortally_jealous+grave_robber=P... please, no! You'd leave me to die?!
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_mortally_jealous+plague_doctor=You'll be sorry when I'm gone!
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_mortally_jealous+occultist=Unwise. 
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_mortally_jealous+jester=So it's come to this.
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_mortally_jealous+leper=Passing judgment on who lives and dies?
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_mortally_jealous+hellion=You'd sacrifice me?!
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_mortally_jealous+runaway=I trusted you! NO!!
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_mortally_jealous+vestal=Left me to fend for myself, have you?
affinity_change_bark_remove_dot_observing_mortally_jealous+flagellant=My glory is foretold, yet you would condemn us!
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_low_stress=We're better off in your company.
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_low_stress=I find your candor most refreshing.
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_low_stress=You've no idea how welcome a change you are.
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_low_stress=A bleak road it would be for your absence.
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_low_stress=You just might be the edge we need.
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_low_stress=Let us take watch together.
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_low_stress=Take a sip of wine?
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_low_stress=I never tire of your stories.
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_low_stress=Another round?
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_low_stress=I dare say, you lend me hope.
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_low_stress=You've got something the others don't.
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_low_stress=The worse it gets, the more we'll need each other.
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_low_stress+highwayman=Think I have some dice rattling around in here...
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_low_stress+highwayman=Heh. Ain't bad, your jokes.

affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_low_stress+man_at_arms=Another story? Glad you asked...
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_low_stress+grave_robber=Share a flask? I'm parched.
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_low_stress+grave_robber=They broke the mold with you.
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_low_stress+plague_doctor=At last! Someone I can work with!

affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_low_stress+leper=You are a rock in troublesome times.
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_low_stress+hellion=The horses like you. A good omen.
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_low_stress+hellion=Born under the right moon, you were!
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_low_stress+runaway=I like you when you're quiet.
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_low_stress+runaway=You ain't so bad.
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_low_stress+vestal=Sit and read with me?

affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_low_stress+flagellant=I sense you are meant for glory.
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_low_stress+flagellant=Pass me that vial of holy vinegar, if you would.
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_med_stress=Tell me it's going to be all right?
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_med_stress=We are not as doomed as I feel, no?
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_med_stress=A game? Something to distract my mind?
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_med_stress=I would rather not sleep alone...
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_med_stress=Tell me, are your dreams troubled as mine?
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_med_stress=I find myself warming to you.
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_med_stress=Be vigilant. I'll sit up with you.

affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_med_stress+grave_robber=You speak so certainly of a future...
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_med_stress+grave_robber=Spare a conversation? It's... too quiet.
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_med_stress+plague_doctor=Do not let me grow morbid...
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_med_stress+plague_doctor=My mind is troubled. Read with me?
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_med_stress+occultist=You're an old soul.

affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_high_stress+highwayman=Sit with me. I'm... tense.
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_high_stress+highwayman=Y'have no idea how much I needed that.
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_high_stress+man_at_arms=Promise me it ain't for naught?
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_high_stress+man_at_arms=You're right - I shouldn't fret.
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_high_stress+grave_robber=You're a welcome distraction.

affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_high_stress+occultist=Let us tend the torch together.
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_high_stress+occultist=What's that? I was being "morose"?
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_high_stress+jester=... Good one.
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_high_stress+jester=Clever head on those shoulders.
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_high_stress+leper=Yours is a soul of worth.

affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_high_stress+hellion=My birthplace calls to me...
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_high_stress+hellion=The end bears down. Let us face it!
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_high_stress+runaway=How do you do it? Keep fighting?
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_high_stress+runaway=Sorry for snappin' at ya.
affinity_change_bark_banter_positive_high_stress+vestal=Some days I fear we are on the losing side...

affinity_change_bark_banter_negative_low_stress+hellion=I was saving that for later!
affinity_change_bark_banter_negative_low_stress+runaway=Can't say I trust you yet.
affinity_change_bark_banter_negative_low_stress+runaway=Why you wanna know so much about me?
affinity_change_bark_banter_negative_low_stress+vestal=I find your hygiene troubling.
affinity_change_bark_banter_negative_low_stress+vestal=You may sit beside me, but be <i>quiet.</i>
affinity_change_bark_banter_negative_low_stress+flagellant=Another unbeliever at my flank...
affinity_change_bark_banter_negative_low_stress+flagellant=I must meditate. Begone.
affinity_change_bark_banter_negative_med_stress=You're a curse upon this voyage.
affinity_change_bark_banter_negative_med_stress=Our luck took a fell turn when we picked you up.
affinity_change_bark_banter_negative_med_stress=That's my bunk! Off!
affinity_change_bark_banter_negative_med_stress=Drunkard! Keep your wits about you!
affinity_change_bark_banter_negative_med_stress=You cowardly seek-sorrow!

affinity_change_bark_banter_negative_med_stress=Your carelessness endangers us!
affinity_change_bark_banter_negative_med_stress+highwayman=You'll double-cross me. I'm sure.
affinity_change_bark_banter_negative_med_stress+highwayman=Accuse me of cheatin' one more time...
affinity_change_bark_banter_negative_med_stress+man_at_arms=Fate has sent you here to torment me.
affinity_change_bark_banter_negative_med_stress+man_at_arms=I might be old but I'll still tan yer hide.
affinity_change_bark_banter_negative_med_stress+grave_robber=You remind me of someone I once loathed.
affinity_change_bark_banter_negative_med_stress+grave_robber=Take your trifling concerns elsewhere.
affinity_change_bark_banter_negative_med_stress+plague_doctor=Have you no sense? I said BEGONE.
affinity_change_bark_banter_negative_med_stress+plague_doctor=You bicker as a child does!
affinity_change_bark_banter_negative_med_stress+occultist=I am a patient man, but I have my limits.
affinity_change_bark_banter_negative_med_stress+occultist=*long-suffering sigh*
affinity_change_bark_banter_negative_med_stress+jester=Your presence is a drain on morale.
affinity_change_bark_banter_negative_med_stress+jester=You exhaust me.
affinity_change_bark_banter_negative_med_stress+leper=Begone. I have suffered long already.
affinity_change_bark_banter_negative_med_stress+leper=Allow a tired man his rest.
affinity_change_bark_banter_negative_med_stress+hellion=Those who sit beside me must EARN it.
affinity_change_bark_banter_negative_med_stress+hellion=You've a coward's stink on you!
