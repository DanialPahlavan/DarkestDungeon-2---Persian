bark_item_oddly_tuned_lute+plague_doctor=Fascinating! My boot taps of its own accord!
bark_item_oddly_tuned_lute+grave_robber=I performed this gavotte as a girl...
bark_item_oddly_tuned_lute+highwayman=Feels nice. Feels... normal.
bark_item_oddly_tuned_lute+bounty_hunter=Nice try. Still ain't singing.
bark_item_oddly_tuned_lute+hellion=Needs drums.
bark_item_oddly_tuned_lute+runaway=Huh. Been ages since I heard music.
bark_item_oddly_tuned_lute+leper=Music often reaches where medicine cannot.
bark_item_oddly_tuned_lute+flagellant=Pass me his sickle while his hands are occupied.
bark_item_oddly_tuned_lute+vestal=Onward! To glory!
bark_item_morbid_joke+highwayman=You ever hear the one about the chandler...?
bark_item_morbid_joke+highwayman=What's red and bad fer your teeth? ... A brick.
bark_item_morbid_joke+highwayman=Dark humour is like food. Not everyone gets it.
bark_item_morbid_joke+occultist=You certainly have a way with words.
bark_item_morbid_joke+man_at_arms=I've heard worse, lad.
bark_item_morbid_joke+plague_doctor=Ehm. Was that the punchline?
bark_item_morbid_joke+grave_robber=That's nothing, darling. How about the one...
bark_item_morbid_joke+jester=... ... ... Heh.
bark_item_morbid_joke+bounty_hunter=*snort*
bark_item_morbid_joke+hellion=Ha HAH!
bark_item_morbid_joke+runaway=I... I don't get it.
bark_item_morbid_joke+leper=If this helps you pass the time...
bark_item_morbid_joke+flagellant=Your blasphemes are tame... but amusing.
bark_item_morbid_joke+vestal=Who raised you?
bark_item_improvised_strategy+man_at_arms=Right, you all listen here...
bark_item_improvised_strategy+man_at_arms=Gather 'round the map, now...
bark_item_improvised_strategy+man_at_arms=At last! A path to victory!
bark_item_improvised_strategy+occultist=Persuasive.
bark_item_improvised_strategy+plague_doctor=Riveting! I follow your logic.
bark_item_improvised_strategy+grave_robber=*yawwwwn* 'Course I'm listening.
bark_item_improvised_strategy+highwayman=Hm. Seems sensible enough.
bark_item_improvised_strategy+jester=Ah, forethought, my old nemesis.
bark_item_improvised_strategy+bounty_hunter=Solid plan.
bark_item_improvised_strategy+hellion=Too much talking.
bark_item_improvised_strategy+runaway=Can't we just try to sneak through?
bark_item_improvised_strategy+leper=The prepared mind slumbers peacefully.
bark_item_improvised_strategy+flagellant=I'll be your vanguard, old man.
bark_item_improvised_strategy+vestal=A forward assault! At last!
bark_item_experimental_remedy+plague_doctor=Fret not - these always fizz!
bark_item_experimental_remedy+plague_doctor=You may feel a slight tingling...!
bark_item_experimental_remedy+plague_doctor=No, it hasn't gone off. That's the sulfur.
bark_item_experimental_remedy+occultist=I dearly hope my sense of smell recovers.
bark_item_experimental_remedy+man_at_arms=Can't be choosy with field medicine.
bark_item_experimental_remedy+grave_robber=I'd swear she enjoys subjecting us to this.
bark_item_experimental_remedy+highwayman=Pass it here. This journey's wearin' me down.
bark_item_experimental_remedy+jester=You're <i>hilarious</i>.
bark_item_experimental_remedy+bounty_hunter=Long as it works...
bark_item_experimental_remedy+hellion=What foul spirits! Yet refreshing!
bark_item_experimental_remedy+runaway=<i>Ugggghhh.</i> I feel queasy.
bark_item_experimental_remedy+leper=Perhaps wasted on one such as I...
bark_item_experimental_remedy+flagellant=Your medicine profanes my flesh. Feh.
bark_item_experimental_remedy+vestal=At least I can render my own aid if this backfires...
bark_item_precious_collection+leper=I will likely never see the shores of home again.
bark_item_precious_collection+leper=Some memories weigh in the pocket - others are lighter.
bark_item_precious_collection+leper=We will never forget that which we can touch.
bark_item_precious_collection+occultist=I too hold on to some remnants of a former life...
bark_item_precious_collection+man_at_arms=Pretty trinkets.
bark_item_precious_collection+plague_doctor=These seem inert. What do they...<i>do?</i>
bark_item_precious_collection+grave_robber=Mm, you've got a story, don't you?
bark_item_precious_collection+highwayman=Bold man, carrying the past around.
bark_item_precious_collection+jester=Shiny. 
bark_item_precious_collection+bounty_hunter=These look expensive.
bark_item_precious_collection+hellion=Talismans hold power.
bark_item_precious_collection+runaway=Oh wow, where'd you get these? They're beautiful!
bark_item_precious_collection+flagellant=I admire a man who can outwit Death at such length.
bark_item_precious_collection+vestal=Shall I pray for them... or for you?
bark_item_tar_filled_colambre+runaway=Heh heh. They never see me coming.
bark_item_tar_filled_colambre+runaway=More fun than wine.
bark_item_tar_filled_colambre+runaway=You're going to burn so hot...
bark_item_guided_meditation+occultist=Walk with me. Let me take you to the outer spheres...
bark_item_guided_meditation+occultist=Let us travel both time and space.
bark_item_guided_meditation+occultist=Who knows what we might discover?
bark_item_guided_meditation+man_at_arms=Can't say I've done <i>this</i> before...
bark_item_guided_meditation+plague_doctor=I remain skeptical. However...
bark_item_guided_meditation+grave_robber=What if we... see... something?
bark_item_guided_meditation+highwayman=Don't normally travel with a guide.
bark_item_guided_meditation+jester=Here, I'll strum a few notes...
bark_item_guided_meditation+bounty_hunter=This is new.
bark_item_guided_meditation+hellion=Our spirit guides would smoke this stuff...
bark_item_guided_meditation+runaway=I don't know... I don't like letting go.
bark_item_guided_meditation+leper=I will walk with you. Let us step beyond ourselves.
bark_item_guided_meditation+flagellant=Why would you stray from your body?
bark_item_guided_meditation+vestal=Every day I blaspheme further...
bark_item_the_very_best+grave_robber=Bottoms up, love.
bark_item_the_very_best+grave_robber=T'your health and pleasure.
bark_item_the_very_best+grave_robber=May we profit while our enemies suffer.
bark_item_war_paint+hellion=Mmm. Smells like my first hunt.
bark_item_war_paint+hellion=These flowers don't grow around here...
bark_item_war_paint+hellion=Mother. Let me do your colours proud.
bark_item_medicinal_leeches=Even the medicine hungers for my blood.
bark_item_medicinal_leeches+man_at_arms=Flinch not! Merely some blood... Errgh.
bark_item_medicinal_leeches+plague_doctor=I recognize this species! Adequate at best.
bark_item_medicinal_leeches+grave_robber=Is my countenance so wan?
bark_item_medicinal_leeches+highwayman=I like my blood where it is.
bark_item_medicinal_leeches+jester=Think that one's lookin' at me.
bark_item_medicinal_leeches+hellion=Is this... food?
bark_item_medicinal_leeches+occultist=A dated technique, but sometimes effective.
bark_item_medicinal_leeches+runaway=Fine. I'll let you, but I won't like it.
bark_item_medicinal_leeches+leper=Ah. We meet again.
bark_item_medicinal_leeches+bounty_hunter=So be it.
bark_item_medicinal_leeches+flagellant=Such sharp little mouths you have.
bark_item_medicinal_leeches+vestal=I prefer rest and prayer, but...
bark_item_holy_hymnal+man_at_arms=Bless ye if y'think I can carry a tune.
bark_item_holy_hymnal+plague_doctor=My, the nun has a robust set of lungs.
bark_item_holy_hymnal+grave_robber=Goodness, some of these are intense.
bark_item_holy_hymnal+highwayman=She really belts these out, eh?
bark_item_holy_hymnal+jester=Simple tunes, but the masses love 'em.
bark_item_holy_hymnal+hellion=Sing for me! Again! Louder!
bark_item_holy_hymnal+occultist=If you believe it will aid us...
bark_item_holy_hymnal+runaway=Never thought I'd hear that one again. Leave me be.
bark_item_holy_hymnal+leper=I'm familiar - though in another tongue...
bark_item_holy_hymnal+bounty_hunter=If you sing 'em.
bark_item_holy_hymnal+vestal=Ahhh, nothing stirs the spirit quite like it!
bark_item_holy_hymnal+flagellant=Your sermons move me no longer, but your <i>passion</i>...
bark_item_holy_hymnal=Ah, I know that dirge...
bark_item_pain_box+man_at_arms=Proof y'can live decades and not see everything.
bark_item_pain_box+plague_doctor=Its mechanisms are hidden, yet its effect undeniable.
bark_item_pain_box+grave_robber=What toxin lurks in that cruel little gadget?
bark_item_pain_box+highwayman=He's enjoyin' this far too much.
bark_item_pain_box+jester=I could see the appeal. In small doses.
bark_item_pain_box+hellion=No.
bark_item_pain_box+occultist=If it brings you focus, friend.
bark_item_pain_box+runaway=That thing looks like a trap.
bark_item_pain_box+leper=Scorpions and frogs come to mind.
bark_item_pain_box+bounty_hunter=Keep that thing away from me.
bark_item_pain_box+vestal=Another rite taken to worrying extremes...
bark_item_pain_box+flagellant=Would you like to witness a miracle?
bark_item_pain_box+flagellant=Stand back - my great work continues!
bark_item_pain_box+flagellant=Soon I won't even need the flail...
bark_item_pain_box=Dreadful stuff. 
bark_item_tinned_preserves+man_at_arms=Could have used these back in my early days!
bark_item_tinned_preserves+plague_doctor=These preservatives, these salts - a marvel!
bark_item_tinned_preserves+grave_robber=So be it. I'll--oh. Well this isn't dreadful.
bark_item_tinned_preserves+highwayman=Eat it now or it'll weigh us down.
bark_item_tinned_preserves+jester=So this is how the other half travels.
bark_item_tinned_preserves+hellion=Meat without blood? City-folk tricks.
bark_item_tinned_preserves+occultist=A sailor's bounty. Perhaps a ship ran aground nearby.
bark_item_tinned_preserves+runaway=Look - y'can cook em in the firepit!
bark_item_tinned_preserves+leper=Delicacies from an earlier time...
bark_item_tinned_preserves+bounty_hunter=*approving grunt*
bark_item_tinned_preserves+vestal=What odd script upon these labels...
bark_item_tinned_preserves+flagellant=Careful you don't cut yourself. Heh heh.
bark_item_tinned_preserves=Seems safe enough.
bark_item_tinned_preserves_use_limit+occultist=We've a hard journey ahead. Save it.
bark_item_tinned_preserves_use_limit+man_at_arms=I'm enjoyin' this fire. Shoo.
bark_item_tinned_preserves_use_limit+plague_doctor=The powders! They suppress my appetite!
bark_item_tinned_preserves_use_limit+grave_robber=Have you any wine instead?
bark_item_tinned_preserves_use_limit+highwayman=Save some for the road, eh.
bark_item_tinned_preserves_use_limit+jester=No, no, none for me.
bark_item_tinned_preserves_use_limit+bounty_hunter=Pass.
bark_item_tinned_preserves_use_limit+hellion=No more of this joyless meat!
bark_item_tinned_preserves_use_limit+runaway=Any fruits? Then no.
bark_item_tinned_preserves_use_limit+leper=There may come a need later.
bark_item_tinned_preserves_use_limit+vestal=I have already broken my fast.
bark_item_tinned_preserves_use_limit+flagellant=I sustain myself through prayer and penance.
bark_item_tinned_preserves_use_limit=Don't deplete our entire stash, hm?
bark_item_orbitoclast+man_at_arms=Y'say it will help me... forget...?
bark_item_orbitoclast+plague_doctor=The past is irrelevant. Excise what you must.
bark_item_orbitoclast+grave_robber=A common threat leveraged at disobedient wives...
bark_item_orbitoclast+highwayman=Suppose it beats drinking to forget.
bark_item_orbitoclast+jester=Heh heh, best of luck in there.
bark_item_orbitoclast+hellion=This... cuts ghosts out of your head...?
bark_item_orbitoclast+occultist=We may free my mind yet. Do it.
bark_item_orbitoclast+runaway=N-no! I don't deserve to forget!
bark_item_orbitoclast+leper=A book, bequeathed to me, worth its freight across the sea...
bark_item_orbitoclast+bounty_hunter=Don't trust this contraption...
bark_item_orbitoclast+vestal=Golden hair, fair skin... why can't I recall her name?
bark_item_orbitoclast+flagellant=One scar closer to purity!
bark_item_orbitoclast=If it will stop the nightmares...
