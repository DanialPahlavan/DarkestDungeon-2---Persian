bark_route_safe+highwayman=Hmph. Can't relax anyhow.
bark_route_safe+grave_robber=Lovely to travel unimpeded for once!
bark_route_safe+grave_robber=Someone make me a drink, would you?
bark_route_safe+grave_robber=For once in our lives, lady luck smiles!
bark_route_safe+grave_robber=Pity this thing still bounces so.

bark_route_rough_patch+leper=I felt that.
bark_route_rough_patch+leper=I never grew seasick, but...
bark_route_rough_patch+leper=We are far from safe grounds now.

bark_route_hazard+hellion=Pathetic!
bark_route_hazard+jester=Cheap trick, I say!
bark_route_hazard+jester=Heh heh. You get used t'this on stage.
bark_route_hazard+jester=Is that the ruins of another coach?
bark_route_hazard+jester=A curious art form.
bark_route_hazard+plague_doctor=Tell me it's not corrosive!
bark_route_hazard+plague_doctor=Not again!
bark_route_hazard+plague_doctor=Are we even attempting to avoid these?!
bark_route_hazard+plague_doctor=Blast it!
bark_route_hazard+runaway=Don't stop!
bark_route_hazard+runaway=Faster - let's get out of here!
bark_route_hazard+runaway=Can't tell what's a trap and what's debris.
bark_route_hazard+runaway=They've made a mess of it!
bark_route_hazard+leper=Rain upon the roof, nothing more.
bark_route_hazard+leper=Our purpose protects.
bark_route_hazard+leper=An inconvenience.
