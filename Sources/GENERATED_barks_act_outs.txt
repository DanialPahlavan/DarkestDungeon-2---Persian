bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_friendly_skill+envious+jester=You wound my feelings.
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_friendly_skill+envious+leper=Such a miser with your aid.
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_friendly_skill+envious+hellion=Kin we are not!
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_friendly_skill+envious+runaway=Funny way of showin' gratitude.

bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_friendly_skill+resentful+leper=A sure-footed step on a fool's journey.
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_friendly_skill+resentful+hellion=I fight at your back no longer!
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_friendly_skill+resentful+runaway=Mind yourselves around that'un.
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_friendly_skill+resentful+vestal=My tolerance wanes.

bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+highwayman=Too slow.
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+man_at_arms=Ill-timed and poorly thought!
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+grave_robber=Are you hoping our enemies simply die of old age?

bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+jester=Kill them, don't tickle them!
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+leper=We cannot leave this journey in your hands.
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+hellion=Shame upon your parents.
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+runaway=You'd never last out there.

bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+suspicious+highwayman=Something ain't right about you.
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+suspicious+man_at_arms=You gainsay our strategy - why?
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+suspicious+grave_robber=So conveniently timed, your missteps!
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+suspicious+plague_doctor=Willful ignorance, perhaps?
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+suspicious+occultist=I am no stranger to deception. Hmm.
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+suspicious+jester=I'd pity you if I trusted you.

bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+suspicious+runaway=You pullin' your punches?
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+suspicious+vestal=Perhaps our foes infiltrate us!
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+suspicious+flagellant=An agent of the abyss in our midst...
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+envious=Just wait 'til your luck runs out.
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+envious+highwayman=Sure wish I could do that.
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+envious+man_at_arms=Oh, if I was younger, just you watch...

bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+resentful+highwayman=You're treadin' on my patience.
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+resentful+man_at_arms=Restin' on your laurels? Now?
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+resentful+grave_robber=Must I do everything myself?
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+resentful+plague_doctor=Shoo! You have no business here!
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+resentful+occultist=So much the worse we are for your "help."
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+resentful+jester=You mock us, surely!

bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+resentful+runaway=Sooner take my chances alone.
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+resentful+vestal=May you wake every morn in torment!
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+resentful+flagellant=You'll wake to barbs in your bed, worm.
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+hateful=Blast it, you're not helping!
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+hateful=Shape up or step aside!
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+hateful=Do you wish us dead?!
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+hateful+highwayman=Stand off or I shoot the next one <i>through</i> you.
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+hateful+man_at_arms=Test me once more and you'll regret it!
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+hateful+grave_robber=Keep a sharp eye on your drinks, <i>friend.</i>
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+hateful+plague_doctor=I blight you! I damn you! Leave us!

bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+hateful+jester=I hate you with particular gusto.
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+hateful+leper=You seek glory but that vault lies grey and empty.
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+hateful+hellion=Damn our enemies! I'll end you myself!
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+hateful+runaway=If you ain't sorry already, you're about to be.
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+hateful+vestal=I cannot even find pity for you.
bark_act_out_partner_insult_for_attack_skill+hateful+flagellant=Loathsome blood-bag. Fall on a blade!
