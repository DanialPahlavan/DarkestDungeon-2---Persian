bark_node_exit_gate+highwayman=What fresh hell is this?
bark_node_exit_gate+highwayman=Eyes peeled...
bark_node_exit_gate+grave_robber=Let us hope we made a swift exit.
bark_node_exit_gate+grave_robber=Ears to the road, loves.
bark_node_exit_gate+occultist=It is worse than my dreams foretold.
bark_node_exit_gate+occultist=Oblivion encroaches, circling in...!
bark_node_exit_gate+hellion=Gods protect us.
bark_node_exit_gate+hellion=I'm having a drink.
bark_node_exit_gate+jester=The show must go on.
bark_node_exit_gate+jester=Too late for a volte-face, I take it?
bark_node_exit_gate+plague_doctor=We are committed! Stay the course!
bark_node_exit_gate+plague_doctor=We must study this world's unmaking...
bark_node_exit_gate+runaway=I've been in worse places...
bark_node_exit_gate+runaway=Let us hope we made a swift exit.
bark_node_exit_gate+leper=...
bark_node_exit_gate+leper=There is beauty all around, even now.
bark_node_exit_gate+man_at_arms=Chaaaarge!
bark_node_exit_gate+man_at_arms=Bandits, horrors - none shall bar us!
bark_node_exit_gate+bounty_hunter=A job is a job. 
bark_node_exit_gate+bounty_hunter=Keep. Moving.
bark_node_exit_gate+vestal=Don't forget why we are here.
bark_node_exit_gate+vestal=Whatever awaits us, have faith.
bark_node_exit_gate+flagellant=On with it! To deliverance!
bark_node_exit_gate+flagellant=We cannot keep absolution waiting!

bark_node_exit_heroselect+highwayman=Let's move.
bark_node_exit_heroselect+highwayman=The potholes are the least of our concerns.
bark_node_exit_heroselect+grave_robber=Cramped quarters to say the least.
bark_node_exit_heroselect+grave_robber=A perilous journey in peculiar company...
bark_node_exit_heroselect+occultist=I have glimpsed the nightmares that await us...
bark_node_exit_heroselect+occultist=Onward into oblivion, then.
bark_node_exit_heroselect+hellion=Hyaaaah! Let's go already!
bark_node_exit_heroselect+hellion=Let us all find noble deaths, then!
bark_node_exit_heroselect+jester=Let me tune this thing before we get going...
bark_node_exit_heroselect+jester=Red sky at dawn - best move on.
bark_node_exit_heroselect+plague_doctor=You will all come to rely on me. I'm sure of it.
bark_node_exit_heroselect+plague_doctor=I wonder... which of you shall be the first casualty?
bark_node_exit_heroselect+runaway=Once more on the run.
bark_node_exit_heroselect+runaway=I don't stop for <i>anyone</i>.
bark_node_exit_heroselect+leper=The wheels turn, the earth spins.
bark_node_exit_heroselect+leper=I accept this new torment as I would a changing season.
bark_node_exit_heroselect+man_at_arms=I've kept worse company.
bark_node_exit_heroselect+man_at_arms=Hah! What a roughcut band we are!
bark_node_exit_heroselect+bounty_hunter=Let me at 'em.
bark_node_exit_heroselect+bounty_hunter=Onward! Light's fading.
bark_node_exit_heroselect+vestal=I take this burden willingly.
bark_node_exit_heroselect+vestal=Toward redemption!
bark_node_exit_heroselect+flagellant=Oh, the delights that await us...
bark_node_exit_heroselect+flagellant=I have dominion over my pain - do you?

bark_node_exit_storyassist+highwayman=Cost us little. Might pay off later.
bark_node_exit_storyassist+highwayman=Good luck to 'em.
bark_node_exit_storyassist+grave_robber=I suppose it pays to assist the rabble... on occasion.
bark_node_exit_storyassist+grave_robber=*gasp* They were positively filthy!
bark_node_exit_storyassist+occultist=Every encounter a karmic shift.
bark_node_exit_storyassist+occultist=Under different stars, we could have been them.
bark_node_exit_storyassist+hellion=On to the next!
bark_node_exit_storyassist+hellion=Feh - they should be fighting!
bark_node_exit_storyassist+jester=Heh heh. So long, then.
bark_node_exit_storyassist+jester=To their tenuous survival. Hear, hear!
bark_node_exit_storyassist+plague_doctor=They survive despite abhorrent conditions - fascinating.
bark_node_exit_storyassist+plague_doctor=Human resilience is truly a marvel.
bark_node_exit_storyassist+runaway=We've wasted enough time - let's be off.
bark_node_exit_storyassist+runaway=We'll see if they have what it takes.
bark_node_exit_storyassist+leper=Abandoned by their lords, left to fight alone...
bark_node_exit_storyassist+leper=Living is a struggle. They understand this.
bark_node_exit_storyassist+man_at_arms=Poor blighters.
bark_node_exit_storyassist+man_at_arms=Might make us allies in the long run.
bark_node_exit_storyassist+bounty_hunter=Better make up the lost light.
bark_node_exit_storyassist+bounty_hunter=The horses are stirring...
bark_node_exit_storyassist+vestal=Charity is a balm for the mind.
bark_node_exit_storyassist+vestal=Even small acts drive the darkness back.
bark_node_exit_storyassist+flagellant=They know not what a gift it is to suffer...
bark_node_exit_storyassist+flagellant=Meant for the plough, not the whip.

bark_node_exit_success_storyresist+highwayman=It's over. Now ready yourselves for the next fight.
bark_node_exit_failure_storyresist+highwayman=That was too close.
bark_node_exit_success_storyresist+grave_robber=Easy enough, I'd say.
bark_node_exit_failure_storyresist+grave_robber=A lady always knows when to make an exit.
bark_node_exit_success_storyresist+occultist=Blood will always flow. On this day, it wasn't ours.
bark_node_exit_failure_storyresist+occultist=I must... meditate. The beast strains at his cage!
bark_node_exit_success_storyresist+hellion=Let's do it again! I'm no coward, I tell you!
bark_node_exit_failure_storyresist+hellion=By the skin of our damned teeth.
bark_node_exit_success_storyresist+jester=Ahh, the melody of murder is on the wind...
bark_node_exit_failure_storyresist+jester=... anyone for a song?
bark_node_exit_success_storyresist+plague_doctor=I would have liked a moment to study their remains...
bark_node_exit_failure_storyresist+plague_doctor=Are you certain we're far enough away...?
bark_node_exit_success_storyresist+runaway=We live to fight another day. Maybe less.
bark_node_exit_failure_storyresist+runaway=We've gotta get out of here! GO!
bark_node_exit_success_storyresist+leper=Survival begets violence, it would seem.
bark_node_exit_failure_storyresist+leper=Come quickly, lest they track us to the coach.
bark_node_exit_success_storyresist+man_at_arms=Hah! Well fought, all!
bark_node_exit_failure_storyresist+man_at_arms=Retreat! Retreat! 
bark_node_exit_success_storyresist+bounty_hunter=Ahh, was that so bad?
bark_node_exit_failure_storyresist+bounty_hunter=I disguised our tracks. Might buy us time.
bark_node_exit_success_storyresist+vestal=Our presence tipped the scales!
bark_node_exit_failure_storyresist+vestal=Abominations to the last!
bark_node_exit_success_storyresist+flagellant=Unworthy witnesses to my becoming!
bark_node_exit_failure_storyresist+flagellant=You'd flee before I am through with them?!

bark_node_exit_hospital+highwayman=I feel better already. Heh.
bark_node_exit_hospital+highwayman=Stroke of luck, meetin' her.
bark_node_exit_hospital+grave_robber=Such conditions - my word!
bark_node_exit_hospital+grave_robber=Woefully inadequate - and unsanitary!
bark_node_exit_hospital+occultist=We leave better than we arrived.
bark_node_exit_hospital+occultist=Tending to the wounded as the world burns - noble, if futile.
bark_node_exit_hospital+hellion=I can respect skill like that, even in some city nun.
bark_node_exit_hospital+hellion=The horrors she must have faced...
bark_node_exit_hospital+jester=She should lighten up a little.
bark_node_exit_hospital+jester=Infirmaries - all the same.
bark_node_exit_hospital+plague_doctor=I suppose one sometimes needs a second opinion.
bark_node_exit_hospital+plague_doctor=I mean, really, it's nothing I couldn't have done!
bark_node_exit_hospital+runaway=Posting up like that? Not for me.
bark_node_exit_hospital+runaway=Glad for the help, but... she's a sitting duck.
bark_node_exit_hospital+leper=Sadly, there is no cure for my condition. Such is the way of things.
bark_node_exit_hospital+leper=May the loathing never take her.
bark_node_exit_hospital+man_at_arms=Patched up and ready to bleed again - hah!
bark_node_exit_hospital+man_at_arms=Lovely woman. Shame about her eye.
bark_node_exit_hospital+bounty_hunter=Quiet yourselves and let 'em work.
bark_node_exit_hospital+bounty_hunter=She's a tough one.
bark_node_exit_hospital+vestal=I might have stayed a night to assist...
bark_node_exit_hospital+vestal=Hmph. My hand is steadier.
bark_node_exit_hospital+flagellant=It is a weak constitution that needs such things.
bark_node_exit_hospital+flagellant=Her gods are no longer listening.

bark_node_exit_store+highwayman=I don't like that creep one bit.
bark_node_exit_store+highwayman=I swear I've seen him before someplace...
bark_node_exit_store+grave_robber=A little shopping is always a welcome diversion.
bark_node_exit_store+grave_robber=That ghastly man - the way he was leering...
bark_node_exit_store+occultist=His mind is as jumbled as his merchandise.
bark_node_exit_store+occultist=I shudder to think of how he accrued his wares.
bark_node_exit_store+hellion=We could have simply strongarmed him!
bark_node_exit_store+hellion=Weak little weasel of a man - bah!
bark_node_exit_store+jester=All that and no accordion? Ridiculous.
bark_node_exit_store+jester=More clutter, eh? Just what we need!
bark_node_exit_store+plague_doctor=I suppose some of his wares held interest...
bark_node_exit_store+plague_doctor=Did you hear him mumbling? Truly mad, that one.
bark_node_exit_store+runaway=He hardly knew where he was.
bark_node_exit_store+runaway=Where'd he get all that stuff, anyway?
bark_node_exit_store+leper=A mirror reflecting a mirror reflecting a mirror...
bark_node_exit_store+leper=By autumn's last moon, the birds have sang their last.
bark_node_exit_store+man_at_arms=Daft one 'e was, eh?
bark_node_exit_store+man_at_arms=Glad to be rid of that nutter.
bark_node_exit_store+bounty_hunter=Count your coin around that one.
bark_node_exit_store+bounty_hunter=Steep prices, but you gotta pay em.
bark_node_exit_store+vestal=Perhaps corruption has touched this one.
bark_node_exit_store+vestal=I am pleased to leave him behind.
bark_node_exit_store+flagellant=Creature comforts slow me down.
bark_node_exit_store+flagellant=Burden me not with your salves and wraps!
bark_node_exit_store+highwayman+valley=Ready as we'll ever be.
bark_node_exit_store+highwayman+valley=Road looks clear, torch is high. Let's go.
bark_node_exit_store+grave_robber+valley=*shiver* Let us not tarry...
bark_node_exit_store+grave_robber+valley=At least we shan't die in the wagonyard.
bark_node_exit_store+occultist+valley=I have caravanned greater distances with less.
bark_node_exit_store+occultist+valley=Let us not deprive ourselves at journey's dawn.
bark_node_exit_store+hellion+valley=Sooner we're moving, the better.
bark_node_exit_store+hellion+valley=A well-stocked larder! 
bark_node_exit_store+jester+valley=A full flask and a foolish quest!
bark_node_exit_store+jester+valley=The epics I'll write if we survive this...
bark_node_exit_store+plague_doctor+valley=Fresh tinctures and powders to sample, ooh!
bark_node_exit_store+plague_doctor+valley=Time to put my latest methods to the test.
bark_node_exit_store+runaway+valley=We're stocked up. Never seen so much food.
bark_node_exit_store+runaway+valley=Eyes out for bandits. We're a tasty target.
bark_node_exit_store+leper+valley=A humble valediction...
bark_node_exit_store+leper+valley=We are ready - purpose is now ours to find.
bark_node_exit_store+man_at_arms+valley=One last chance to steel the ol' nerves.
bark_node_exit_store+man_at_arms+valley=A well-provisioned unit, we are!
bark_node_exit_store+bounty_hunter+valley=Bet the bandits love this stretch of road.
bark_node_exit_store+bounty_hunter+valley=I travel light.
bark_node_exit_store+vestal+valley=We are well blessed.
bark_node_exit_store+vestal+valley=We journey toward darkness' heart.
bark_node_exit_store+flagellant+valley=It calls to me, this weeping world.
bark_node_exit_store+flagellant+valley=Onward to the source! I must taste of it.

bark_node_exit_watchtower+highwayman=Better to know how bad it is, I guess.
bark_node_exit_watchtower+highwayman=Drink won't be enough to wash this view out...
bark_node_exit_watchtower+grave_robber=The view would have been lovely... if not for... the state of things.
bark_node_exit_watchtower+grave_robber=It's a bit overwhelming, to see it all... undone...
bark_node_exit_watchtower+occultist=Oblivion opens her throat to us...
bark_node_exit_watchtower+occultist=What is clear now is that <i>everything</i> depends on our success.
bark_node_exit_watchtower+hellion=The forests, the fields - gone! Ruined!
bark_node_exit_watchtower+hellion=We are in hell, aren't we?
bark_node_exit_watchtower+jester=*quiet, off-kilter laughter*
bark_node_exit_watchtower+jester=A beautiful day, wouldn't you agree? Heheh.
bark_node_exit_watchtower+plague_doctor=The land aches, livid with pestilence!
bark_node_exit_watchtower+plague_doctor=Are we all that remains?
bark_node_exit_watchtower+runaway=What a long road ahead. Longer behind.
bark_node_exit_watchtower+runaway=Shouldn't have looked. Head down, keep moving.
bark_node_exit_watchtower+leper=Our flame must cauterize these wounds.
bark_node_exit_watchtower+leper=Even in devastation - beauty. Promise.
bark_node_exit_watchtower+man_at_arms=... it's 'orrible.
bark_node_exit_watchtower+man_at_arms=Awful mess all around, innit.
bark_node_exit_watchtower+bounty_hunter=Least we know what's coming.
bark_node_exit_watchtower+bounty_hunter=Stay the course. Keep moving.
bark_node_exit_watchtower+vestal=We must stand witness.
bark_node_exit_watchtower+vestal=... I must pray.
bark_node_exit_watchtower+flagellant=... the throbbing of a putrefying heart...
bark_node_exit_watchtower+flagellant=*soft, wondrous gasp*

bark_node_exit_storycosmic+highwayman=Nothing worth taking.
bark_node_exit_storycosmic+highwayman=Academics and their indulgences... feh.
bark_node_exit_storycosmic+grave_robber=No trinkets? No baubles? No interest.
bark_node_exit_storycosmic+grave_robber=Well, <i>that</i> was frightfully boring.
bark_node_exit_storycosmic+occultist=Fascinating. Could we not go back for a second look?
bark_node_exit_storycosmic+occultist=Such an eclectic collection!
bark_node_exit_storycosmic+hellion=Rubbish and nonsense!
bark_node_exit_storycosmic+hellion=Get us out of here. Find us a foe to face!
bark_node_exit_storycosmic+jester=Must've dozed off...
bark_node_exit_storycosmic+jester=*yawn*
bark_node_exit_storycosmic+plague_doctor=The ravings of a mind poisoned by the occult!
bark_node_exit_storycosmic+plague_doctor=Superstition has no place in science.
bark_node_exit_storycosmic+runaway=Madmen pursing madness - I want none of it.
bark_node_exit_storycosmic+runaway=Let's get far away from this place.
bark_node_exit_storycosmic+leper=Mankind and mystery... one forever outpacing the other.
bark_node_exit_storycosmic+leper=Try as it might, the sun cannot catch the moon.
bark_node_exit_storycosmic+man_at_arms=What was that all about, then?
bark_node_exit_storycosmic+man_at_arms=Break out the provisions, eh?
bark_node_exit_storycosmic+bounty_hunter=Wouldn't touch it if I were you.
bark_node_exit_storycosmic+bounty_hunter=Hrm. 
bark_node_exit_storycosmic+vestal=Only foulness found there.
bark_node_exit_storycosmic+vestal=Let us hurry onward.
bark_node_exit_storycosmic+flagellant=More stimulating pursuits await.
bark_node_exit_storycosmic+flagellant=Power lurks down unexpected corridors.

bark_node_exit_success_storycultist+highwayman=Hah! That'll buy us a little time.
bark_node_exit_failure_storycultist+highwayman=I don't <i>ever</i> want to cut it that close again.
bark_node_exit_success_storycultist+grave_robber=You lot aren't welcome here, savvy?
bark_node_exit_failure_storycultist+grave_robber=... gleaming horrors not of our world... 
bark_node_exit_success_storycultist+occultist=Begone! Return to whatever void birthed you!
bark_node_exit_failure_storycultist+occultist=How deep, the void between the stars...
bark_node_exit_success_storycultist+hellion=HAH! The rush of a hard-earned kill!
bark_node_exit_failure_storycultist+hellion=*chattering teeth*
bark_node_exit_success_storycultist+jester=That melody... I've killed to it before...
bark_node_exit_failure_storycultist+jester=What's that ringing in my ears?!
bark_node_exit_success_storycultist+plague_doctor=Intriguing specimens, but better off dead!
bark_node_exit_failure_storycultist+plague_doctor=Their physiology... so alien... no! NO!
bark_node_exit_success_storycultist+runaway=They burn the same as anyone else.
bark_node_exit_failure_storycultist+runaway=I hear them! They're GAINING ON US!!
bark_node_exit_success_storycultist+leper=Aberrations. I feel lighter for their absence.
bark_node_exit_failure_storycultist+leper=Circled we are, buzzards above...
bark_node_exit_success_storycultist+man_at_arms=Drive the bastards back to their hole!
bark_node_exit_failure_storycultist+man_at_arms=I will not stand and fight! I cannot! RETREAT!
bark_node_exit_success_storycultist+bounty_hunter=Send those freaks packing.
bark_node_exit_failure_storycultist+bounty_hunter=Hear that wailing? They hunt us still.
bark_node_exit_success_storycultist+vestal=The Light guides my hand!
bark_node_exit_failure_storycultist+vestal=*frenzied, mumbled prayer*
bark_node_exit_success_storycultist+flagellant=Undeserving of the pain they'd mete out!
bark_node_exit_failure_storycultist+flagellant=AT LAST! A worthy torment! 

bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+highwayman+forest=Old bones ought to stay down.
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+highwayman+forest=Eyes feel heavy... gotta... stay on my feet...
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+highwayman+farm=And <i>stay</i> down.
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+highwayman+farm=... what's the worst you've ever eaten to survive...?
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+highwayman+city=Strange way to feed our flame, but I'll take it.
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+highwayman+city=So certain we were - and so wrong...
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+highwayman+coast=Good riddance.
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+highwayman+coast=Damn the horses - run!
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+grave_robber+forest=What's dead should stay buried. Trust me.
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+grave_robber+forest=Is this what awaits me at the end? Dreaming forever?
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+grave_robber+farm=Vile things! Another stain scrubbed clean.
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+grave_robber+farm=*strangled retching* Avert your eyes! Don't watch me...
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+grave_robber+city=A marvelous collection - sullied, now... *sigh*
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+grave_robber+city=The city is beyond saving. So too are we.
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+grave_robber+coast=The fiend is felled - now for the booty.
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+grave_robber+coast=I hear weeping in the mist...
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+occultist+forest=Perhaps I will sleep unbothered tonight...
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+occultist+forest=What haunts await us next we close our eyes...?
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+occultist+farm=Life may return to these fields in time.
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+occultist+farm=We are all but flesh in the jaws of something greater.
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+occultist+city=So many precious volumes lost... yet we remain.
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+occultist+city=The minds of "great" men - all rotten! All depraved!
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+occultist+coast=Back to your trench, foul leviathan!
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+occultist+coast=Strange tides, a stench that clogs the nose...
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+hellion+forest=Listen. The birds are finally stirring again.
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+hellion+forest=Rot! Bile! Scavengers closing in...!
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+hellion+farm=*spits* Spirits curse this forsaken place. Let's go.
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+hellion+farm=Flee! And salt the earth behind us!
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+hellion+city=Weak city bodies AND hearts! FALL ON MY BLADE!
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+hellion+city=Fools for trying. Cowards for running. RRRGH...!
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+hellion+coast=The dry land belongs to us, fiend!
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+hellion+coast=Bells toll for us in the fog! RUN!
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+jester+forest=How very like soldiers - dying in rank.
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+jester+forest=That drumming... it's IN my HEAD...!
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+jester+farm=You won't be dining on us tonight, fiends!
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+jester+farm=*sniff* Skin blackening over meat... 
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+jester+city=Talk about a pyrrhic victory. Heheh.
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+jester+city=*slow, discordant humming*
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+jester+coast=Bon voyage!
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+jester+coast=I prefer to die where they can find my corpse!
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+plague_doctor+forest=What a strange new process of decay that was!
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+plague_doctor+forest=They defy science. They should not BE!
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+plague_doctor+farm=I wonder what mother could birth such a curiosity.
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+plague_doctor+farm=How long can a stomach go empty? I'll investigate.
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+plague_doctor+city=I wonder at the formula for their accelerants...
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+plague_doctor+city=Man's great scholarly works in ashes! Fools! FOOLS!
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+plague_doctor+coast=Did you spy its ocular membranes? Curious...
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+plague_doctor+coast=Overpowering, mouldering corruption!
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+runaway+forest=Let's raze these weeds and get back on the road.
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+runaway+forest=Burn it all down behind us. That mumbling...
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+runaway+farm=Torch the fields just to be sure, I say.
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+runaway+farm=I'd sooner starve than ever smell meat again.
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+runaway+city=Oh, you want to burn, do you?! Then BURN!
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+runaway+city=N-no... let me go back... it's so warm in there...
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+runaway+coast=Whatever that thing was, it's dead now.
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+runaway+coast=This damp is settling in my bones...
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+leper+forest=A tall tree falls in the forest - all is quiet.
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+leper+forest=Doomed warriors never granted the peace of the grave...
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+leper+farm=A cruel contrivance of starvation and excess.
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+leper+farm=Let these fields lie fallow forever. We have lost them.
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+leper+city=A city under siege - but stirring within its walls, hope.
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+leper+city=Let the flames feast on the corpse of man's hubris.
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+leper+coast=The stone defies the eroding waves.
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+leper+coast=Halt. Let us accept our end with composure.
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+man_at_arms+forest=This foul mimicry of a campaign must end.
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+man_at_arms+forest=Their faces...! Brothers, have you come for me at last?
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+man_at_arms+farm=Perhaps the people can rebuild. I hope so.
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+man_at_arms+farm=Ghkk! Bile in my throat... the smell...!
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+man_at_arms+city=There are folk in this town not yet lost to madness.
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+man_at_arms+city=This city is sick. Perhaps it <i>should</i> fall to ashes...
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+man_at_arms+coast=We made chum of the bastards!
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+man_at_arms+coast=Retreat! If you want my blood, it won't come gifted!
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+bounty_hunter+forest=An old contract collected...
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+bounty_hunter+forest=They saw us coming.
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+bounty_hunter+farm=Another trophy for the mantle.
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+bounty_hunter+farm=Amateurs! I could have had them!
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+bounty_hunter+city=Not the first madman I've put down.
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+bounty_hunter+city=Follow my lead next time.
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+bounty_hunter+coast=The bigger they are...
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+bounty_hunter+coast=Not worth it. Back to dry land!
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+vestal+forest=Poor restless souls.
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+vestal+forest=We have disturbed a burial site!
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+vestal+farm=How far the folk have strayed...
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+vestal+farm=There is no redemption to be found here.
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+vestal+city=If we're to rebuild, we must retain knowledge.
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+vestal+city=A den of horror and devils...
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+vestal+coast=We must turn these people down a better path!
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+vestal+coast=Away! There are no souls to save here!
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+flagellant+forest=Carve your path upon me, lost little souls.
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+flagellant+forest=Leave them. Sad, dry things.
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+flagellant+farm=I've no interest in their looted luxuries.
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+flagellant+farm=To the lash with me!
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+flagellant+city=What a boring use for fire.
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+flagellant+city=My wounds are my own! Tend me not.
bark_node_exit_success_dungeon+flagellant+coast=A thrilling distraction. To the next!
bark_node_exit_failure_dungeon+flagellant+coast=Damned sea-chill! I've gone numb!

bark_node_exit_success_guardian+highwayman=In and out - a perfect job!
bark_node_exit_failure_guardian+highwayman=Let's get the hell out of here!
bark_node_exit_success_guardian+grave_robber=I daresay we're getting the hang of this.
bark_node_exit_failure_guardian+grave_robber=I-it's too much! That was too much!
bark_node_exit_success_guardian+occultist=Another abomination falls!
bark_node_exit_failure_guardian+occultist=I-I could never have imagined...
bark_node_exit_success_guardian+hellion=AKYLORAAAHHH! 
bark_node_exit_failure_guardian+hellion=N-no! No more!
bark_node_exit_success_guardian+jester=Ha HA! Time for a song!
bark_node_exit_failure_guardian+jester=Joke's on us then, eh?
bark_node_exit_success_guardian+plague_doctor=Precision! Poise! A successful operation!
bark_node_exit_failure_guardian+plague_doctor=H-how could it... I don't...
bark_node_exit_success_guardian+runaway=Whew, we did it...!
bark_node_exit_failure_guardian+runaway=RUN!
bark_node_exit_success_guardian+leper=A sunrise at last.
bark_node_exit_failure_guardian+leper=Pity the starless sky.
bark_node_exit_success_guardian+man_at_arms=We've done it <i>together!</i> A fighting family!
bark_node_exit_failure_guardian+man_at_arms=RETREAT! It's a rout...!
bark_node_exit_success_guardian+bounty_hunter=Could take a dozen of 'em.
bark_node_exit_failure_guardian+bounty_hunter=They'll follow. Get a move on.
bark_node_exit_success_guardian+vestal=Bloodshed purifies!
bark_node_exit_failure_guardian+vestal=The darkness empowers them...!
bark_node_exit_success_guardian+flagellant=Feed me your transgressions.
bark_node_exit_failure_guardian+flagellant=Prostrate yourselves!

bark_node_exit_cache+highwayman=Nice.
bark_node_exit_cache+highwayman=It's something, at least.
bark_node_exit_cache+grave_robber=We've had a poor run at the tables, as they say.
bark_node_exit_cache+grave_robber=And away without an ambush to boot! Bravo.
bark_node_exit_cache+occultist=We must tend our stores wisely.
bark_node_exit_cache+occultist=A most fortunate find.
bark_node_exit_cache+hellion=Ha HAH! Good for us!
bark_node_exit_cache+hellion=Off we go, then!
bark_node_exit_cache+jester=Will any of this stuff even matter?
bark_node_exit_cache+jester=Where are we going to put all this?
bark_node_exit_cache+plague_doctor=Fortuitous! Some of my powders were dwindling...
bark_node_exit_cache+plague_doctor=Well stocked and ready for triage!
bark_node_exit_cache+runaway=Take all we can carry. Quick.
bark_node_exit_cache+runaway=Nice find!
bark_node_exit_cache+leper=Some fortunate thread in fate's tangled skein.
bark_node_exit_cache+leper=Fortune is fickle, but today she smiles.
bark_node_exit_cache+man_at_arms=Tooth and tail, as they say.
bark_node_exit_cache+man_at_arms=Every army needs a supply line.
bark_node_exit_cache+bounty_hunter=Let's not weigh ourselves down.
bark_node_exit_cache+bounty_hunter=None for me. I like to stay a little hungry.
bark_node_exit_cache+vestal=We can share what we cannot carry.
bark_node_exit_cache+vestal=We are on the right path.
bark_node_exit_cache+flagellant=Do what you will with my share.
bark_node_exit_cache+flagellant=Mm, sutures - perhaps I could allow it.

bark_node_exit_altarofhope+highwayman=Perhaps this place ain't so far gone.
bark_node_exit_altarofhope+highwayman=Almost feels like we're makin' a difference...
bark_node_exit_altarofhope+grave_robber=How fiercely they fight to retain so little...
bark_node_exit_altarofhope+grave_robber=A bizarre, charitable urge grips me...
bark_node_exit_altarofhope+occultist=Mistake it not - there is evidence of progress.
bark_node_exit_altarofhope+occultist=Let us lighten some heavy spirits.
bark_node_exit_altarofhope+hellion=These folk will find their mettle!
bark_node_exit_altarofhope+hellion=Hear that? A falcon! She screams a fair omen!
bark_node_exit_altarofhope+jester=With our aid, these poor bastards might make it.
bark_node_exit_altarofhope+jester=Imagine it - bein' part of the world again...
bark_node_exit_altarofhope+plague_doctor=Satisfying work! We bring these people progress.
bark_node_exit_altarofhope+plague_doctor=I have much to teach the common folk...
bark_node_exit_altarofhope+runaway=If we win this, what then? Where would you go...?
bark_node_exit_altarofhope+runaway=Don't wanna get my hopes up, but...
bark_node_exit_altarofhope+leper=These lands are not dead - merely dormant.
bark_node_exit_altarofhope+leper=I am fated to die - let it be here, in service.
bark_node_exit_altarofhope+man_at_arms=Slow an' steady, the war crawls on.
bark_node_exit_altarofhope+man_at_arms=Finally - a good use for an old warhorse...
bark_node_exit_altarofhope+bounty_hunter=Odds ain't good, but they've been worse.
bark_node_exit_altarofhope+bounty_hunter=Gather yourselves.
bark_node_exit_altarofhope+vestal=If we turn a few more souls to our side...
bark_node_exit_altarofhope+vestal=I see it clearly, a path toward rebuilding...
bark_node_exit_altarofhope+flagellant=My veins are alive with purpose!
bark_node_exit_altarofhope+flagellant=Follow us, wretches! Align to our sacred path!

bark_node_exit_bridge+highwayman=What's that chill?
bark_node_exit_bridge+highwayman=No turning back now.
bark_node_exit_bridge+grave_robber=Hold fast to your memories of sunny days - they are no more.
bark_node_exit_bridge+grave_robber=*sigh* So be it.
bark_node_exit_bridge+occultist=We are beyond the wards now... vulnerable.
bark_node_exit_bridge+occultist=We have trained for this - but are we ready?
bark_node_exit_bridge+hellion=Let us leave the past behind!
bark_node_exit_bridge+hellion=Is this where we find glory...?
bark_node_exit_bridge+jester=Hello darkness, my old friend.
bark_node_exit_bridge+jester=Suppose I've got nothing else on.
bark_node_exit_bridge+plague_doctor=The great experiment begins...
bark_node_exit_bridge+plague_doctor=Time to put my learnings to practice.
bark_node_exit_bridge+runaway=We're on our own now.
bark_node_exit_bridge+runaway=Better in here than out there.
bark_node_exit_bridge+leper=Four roads converge into one path. Our path.
bark_node_exit_bridge+leper=Wheels spin as the earth does - eternal.
bark_node_exit_bridge+man_at_arms=So this is what we've been waitin' on...
bark_node_exit_bridge+man_at_arms=Behind enemy lines...
bark_node_exit_bridge+bounty_hunter=The hunt is on.
bark_node_exit_bridge+bounty_hunter=I'll make this worth your coin.
bark_node_exit_bridge+vestal=May our passage be swift.
bark_node_exit_bridge+vestal=Take heart - our cause is just.
bark_node_exit_bridge+flagellant=This is what I was made for!
bark_node_exit_bridge+flagellant=Faster! Death nips at our heels!

bark_node_exit_oasis+highwayman=That weren't so bad. On with it.
bark_node_exit_oasis+highwayman=Back to the unrelenting horrors, eh.
bark_node_exit_oasis+grave_robber=No rest for the wicked, loves.
bark_node_exit_oasis+grave_robber=Let us hope my hair dries in a timely fashion...
bark_node_exit_oasis+occultist=Clean fingernails and rested mind - a rarity.
bark_node_exit_oasis+occultist=An oasis on the road is a rare blessing.
bark_node_exit_oasis+hellion=Smells like horse in here.
bark_node_exit_oasis+hellion=Fresh bloodstains await us!
bark_node_exit_oasis+jester=Eugh. My stockings got wet...
bark_node_exit_oasis+jester=I daresay that was almost pleasant.
bark_node_exit_oasis+plague_doctor=Refreshed, revitalized, ready.
bark_node_exit_oasis+plague_doctor=Have my robes <i>always<i> smelt of Javel water?
bark_node_exit_oasis+runaway=Hope that stop didn't cost us...
bark_node_exit_oasis+runaway=Huh. Been ages since I saw my own reflection.
bark_node_exit_oasis+leper=Golden sun on clear water - a good omen.
bark_node_exit_oasis+leper=Silvery moon on dark water - a sign, perhaps.
bark_node_exit_oasis+man_at_arms=Back at it, you lot.
bark_node_exit_oasis+man_at_arms=*gentle snoring*
bark_node_exit_oasis+bounty_hunter=*gulp* Ahhh.
bark_node_exit_oasis+bounty_hunter=We'll look the fool if we're ambushed...
bark_node_exit_oasis+vestal=... I require a moment's privacy.
bark_node_exit_oasis+vestal=You know what is said of cleanliness.
bark_node_exit_oasis+flagellant=Ahh, something in this stings...! Mm.
bark_node_exit_oasis+flagellant=How could you hope to purify what is already divine?

bark_node_exit_success_creatureden+highwayman=One less hazard on the road.
bark_node_exit_failure_creatureden+highwayman=They may pursue us - staunch that bleeding.
bark_node_exit_success_creatureden+grave_robber=Ahh, the coach smells lovely by comparison.
bark_node_exit_failure_creatureden+grave_robber=Horrid things. Make haste from here!
bark_node_exit_success_creatureden+occultist=Minor horrors in the scheme of things.
bark_node_exit_failure_creatureden+occultist=An unnatural gait to those creatures...
bark_node_exit_success_creatureden+hellion=Wouldn't chance the meat. Pity.
bark_node_exit_failure_creatureden+hellion=Madness! Run!
bark_node_exit_success_creatureden+jester=Heheh. Good riddance.
bark_node_exit_failure_creatureden+jester=My bloodstains have bloodstains.
bark_node_exit_success_creatureden+plague_doctor=See here, I was able to sample some ichors...
bark_node_exit_failure_creatureden+plague_doctor=No classroom dissection could prepare me for this!
bark_node_exit_success_creatureden+runaway=Ashes to ashes.
bark_node_exit_failure_creatureden+runaway=Can't these horses go any faster?!
bark_node_exit_success_creatureden+leper=Spring rains bring a cleansing flood.
bark_node_exit_failure_creatureden+leper=Above scampering mice, the raptor's shadow.
bark_node_exit_success_creatureden+man_at_arms=Human smarts still win the day, eh?
bark_node_exit_failure_creatureden+man_at_arms=Bah! We were unprepared - overconfident!
bark_node_exit_success_creatureden+bounty_hunter=Easy prey, easy pay.
bark_node_exit_failure_creatureden+bounty_hunter=Outwitted by beasts? Feh.
bark_node_exit_success_creatureden+vestal=Beasts cannot be saved.
bark_node_exit_failure_creatureden+vestal=Preternatural cunning!
bark_node_exit_success_creatureden+flagellant=A taste of their own venom, heh heh.
bark_node_exit_failure_creatureden+flagellant=My wounds! How gloriously they seep!

bark_node_exit_success_gauntchirurgeon+highwayman=Let's hope our haul was worth it.
bark_node_exit_failure_gauntchirurgeon+highwayman=... least we got out.
bark_node_exit_success_gauntchirurgeon+grave_robber=And the spoils to us. Well deserved.
bark_node_exit_failure_gauntchirurgeon+grave_robber=A flask, to steady my hands...!
bark_node_exit_success_gauntchirurgeon+occultist=Intriguing curiosities - anything useful?
bark_node_exit_failure_gauntchirurgeon+occultist=Nothing to be learned from such brutality.
bark_node_exit_success_gauntchirurgeon+hellion=Damn him and damn his tricks!
bark_node_exit_failure_gauntchirurgeon+hellion=I almost had him! Cowards!
bark_node_exit_success_gauntchirurgeon+jester=Was he dissecting 'em or patching 'em up...?
bark_node_exit_failure_gauntchirurgeon+jester=Bad medicine, that. Heh heh. 
bark_node_exit_success_gauntchirurgeon+plague_doctor=Allow me to explain these tools...!
bark_node_exit_failure_gauntchirurgeon+plague_doctor=Such barbaric methods, yet oddly enthralling...
bark_node_exit_success_gauntchirurgeon+runaway=Eugh, his stash was covered in leech goo.
bark_node_exit_failure_gauntchirurgeon+runaway=This close to gettin' dismembered...
bark_node_exit_success_gauntchirurgeon+leper=They mime the motions of humanity, even in death...
bark_node_exit_failure_gauntchirurgeon+leper=... hope, the intoxicant of many a fool.
bark_node_exit_success_gauntchirurgeon+man_at_arms=Lucky we've any of our own blood left, eh!
bark_node_exit_failure_gauntchirurgeon+man_at_arms=Was like he was lookin' through us...
bark_node_exit_success_gauntchirurgeon+bounty_hunter=Nab anything good?
bark_node_exit_failure_gauntchirurgeon+bounty_hunter=Close one, even fer us.
bark_node_exit_success_gauntchirurgeon+vestal=A further blow to those who stray from the Light!
bark_node_exit_failure_gauntchirurgeon+vestal=... I can feel them crawling on me...
bark_node_exit_success_gauntchirurgeon+flagellant=A play-actor at the TRUE consecration of the flesh!
bark_node_exit_failure_gauntchirurgeon+flagellant=We fled that pretender?! Turn back around!




















bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_HWY_01=I <i>earned</i> that second chance.
bark_node_exit_failure_storyhero+herostory_HWY_01=What's a few broken knuckles, eh?
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_HWY_02=Justice is seldom seen on the road.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_HWY_03=A meal wasn't all I was starved for.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_HWY_04=Loved the thrill... and hated that I still loved it.
bark_node_exit_failure_storyhero+herostory_HWY_04=Ought to have known better.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_HWY_05=Did he set me up? Does it even matter?
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_HWY_06=So much for second chances.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_GR_01=I masked my venom - as a young Lady must.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_GR_02=That gasp as he expired was the only time he ever pleasured me.
bark_node_exit_failure_storyhero+herostory_GR_02=He would rue the gods-damned day...!
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_GR_03=Even more worthless than I thought him, the wretch.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_GR_04=The things a woman learns about herself.
bark_node_exit_failure_storyhero+herostory_GR_04=I would not let myself die destitute. 
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_GR_05=I was guilty only of impulsivity... truly...
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_GR_06=Right and wrong matter naught. Hell is here regardless.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_OCC_01=It was... lonely, in the void. 
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_OCC_02=Something in those silent halls sang out to only me.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_OCC_03=Why mourn things that only held me back?
bark_node_exit_failure_storyhero+herostory_OCC_03=True seekers shed such limitations.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_OCC_04=All knowledge comes at a price.
bark_node_exit_failure_storyhero+herostory_OCC_04=They were fools to trust me.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_OCC_05=Well... my mind is certainly no longer lonely.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_OCC_06=The stars roil and seethe. I never truly sleep.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_HEL_01=Glory was mine for the taking.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_HEL_02=True battle was nothing like the training pits.
bark_node_exit_failure_storyhero+herostory_HEL_02=The naysayers in camp... they knew...!
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_HEL_03=My brothers, my sisters, calling for me as they died...
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_HEL_04=A coward's death was too good for me!
bark_node_exit_failure_storyhero+herostory_HEL_04=When an ox can no longer pull, we put it down.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_HEL_05=Let my coward's blood soak the dirt.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_HEL_06=If I slay my way to glory, what kin await me...?
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_JES_01=It calls to me, even as a memory...
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_JES_02=Ever wanted something so bad your bones ache?
bark_node_exit_failure_storyhero+herostory_JES_02=Desire and despair, merry bedfellows.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_JES_03=Hmph. You'd have snapped, too.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_JES_04=Could have played 'til that whole <i>city</i> stood empty.
bark_node_exit_failure_storyhero+herostory_JES_04=Power - sweeter than the high from any pipe.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_JES_05=That massacre was my magnum opus. 
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_JES_06=Suppose I'll have to die the old-fashioned way.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_PD_01=Fools! Conventional, tedious fools!
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_PD_02=Those philistines <i>earned</i> my ire.
bark_node_exit_failure_storyhero+herostory_PD_02=Their whispers mock me even now...
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_PD_03=A fitting fate. I regret nothing!
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_PD_04=It was genius! ... genius...
bark_node_exit_failure_storyhero+herostory_PD_04=Was this triumph? Or another failed experiment?
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_PD_05=What horror I have wrought.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_PD_06=How many must I put down before, at last, silence?
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_RUN_01=So much for their oath of charity.
bark_node_exit_failure_storyhero+herostory_RUN_01=They marked me like a mule, so I kicked.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_RUN_02=I barely knew what to do with kindness.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_RUN_03=Everyone remembers their first love...
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_RUN_04=Rapture and pain - one and the same.
bark_node_exit_failure_storyhero+herostory_RUN_04=Why didn't I even <i>try</i> to warn them...?
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_RUN_05=My scars ache...
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_RUN_06=Fire can't be tamed. 
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_LEP_01=Compassion is its own strength.
bark_node_exit_failure_storyhero+herostory_LEP_01=You all might learn some lessons in mercy.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_LEP_02=I mourned my body and the kingdom I might have forged.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_LEP_03=The sun rises and sets, unwavering.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_LEP_04=A diagnosis - and a remedy - freeing in its finality.
bark_node_exit_failure_storyhero+herostory_LEP_04=The palace's very foundations trembled...
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_LEP_05=The time for mourning is past. 
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_LEP_06=A worthy heart beats in this world yet.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_MAA_01=Don't say you squits never dreamed of victory.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_MAA_02=Deserted by my own cunning...
bark_node_exit_failure_storyhero+herostory_MAA_02=Why couldn't they bloody listen?!
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_MAA_03=I was but a child playing commander.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_MAA_04=A cursed old fool, bogged down by despair.
bark_node_exit_failure_storyhero+herostory_MAA_04=Was I even worthy of sending them off?
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_MAA_05=I repay them wound by wound.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_MAA_06=Til my final skirmish, my shield is your shield.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_VES_01=A simple life. Fulfilling to a point.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_VES_02=My eyes were open. I ached for more.
bark_node_exit_failure_storyhero+herostory_VES_02=Distraction everywhere I turned...
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_VES_03=I no longer fear the dark.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_VES_04=The truth can not be long hidden.
bark_node_exit_failure_storyhero+herostory_VES_04=He reeked of blood...
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_VES_05=I was not wrong, but others suffered for my hubris.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_VES_06=How many lives owed to balance my ledgers...?
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_FLG_01=Deliverance touched me that day.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_FLG_02=They know not what they have wasted.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_FLG_03=Exquisite agony.
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_FLG_04=My great work has only just begun!
bark_node_exit_failure_storyhero+herostory_FLG_04=Slow my hand not, spectre!
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_FLG_05=Death cannot have me until I've bled my last!
bark_node_exit_success_storyhero+herostory_FLG_06=Wonders. Raptures beyond measure. I'll show them!
