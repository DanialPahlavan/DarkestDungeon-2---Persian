vo_hero_story_plague_doctor_ch1_text_2=had an ironically invigorating effect upon her 'extracurricular experiments.'
vo_hero_story_plague_doctor_ch1_text_3=The mysteries of the human body - of life and death itself - hovered just beyond her scalpel's reach...
vo_hero_story_plague_doctor_ch1_text_4=... if only she could acquire a corpse of sufficient freshness.
vo_hero_story_plague_doctor_ch2_slam_0=Chapter Two: Head of the Class
vo_hero_story_plague_doctor_ch2_fight_start_0=Her professor was a relic,
vo_hero_story_plague_doctor_ch2_fight_start_1=hacking and wheezing his way through a hopelessly conventional curriculum!
vo_hero_story_plague_doctor_ch2_fight_reward_0=She delighted in the combative debate, and, 
vo_hero_story_plague_doctor_ch2_fight_reward_1=behind her bookish glasses, reveled in their outrage and confusion.
vo_hero_story_plague_doctor_ch3_slam_0=Chapter Three: Extra Credit
vo_hero_story_plague_doctor_ch3_text_0=By the second semester, her research was at a critical point.
vo_hero_story_plague_doctor_ch3_text_1=And regular supply raids of the University laboratories had become necessary.
vo_hero_story_plague_doctor_ch3_text_2=During one such expedition, she stumbled upon her professor,
vo_hero_story_plague_doctor_ch3_text_3=awkwardly slumped over his podium, a bloody kerchief on the floor.
vo_hero_story_plague_doctor_ch3_text_4=Here, then, was her ideal cadaver, her long-awaited opportunity. And she would not waste it.
vo_hero_story_plague_doctor_ch4_slam_0=Chapter Four: Failing Grade
vo_hero_story_plague_doctor_ch4_fight_start_0=Success! Vindication. The human machine restored to action! 
vo_hero_story_plague_doctor_ch4_fight_reward_0=The shrieking and wailing was horrible, but the silence that followed... was even worse.
vo_hero_story_plague_doctor_ch5_slam_0=Chapter Five: Do No Harm
vo_hero_story_plague_doctor_ch5_text_0=Disposal of the body was a procedural affair,
vo_hero_story_plague_doctor_ch5_text_1=a carboy of acid would dissolve the thing, and no evidence would remain.
vo_hero_story_plague_doctor_ch5_text_2=In the weeks that followed, however, she found herself unable to focus,
vo_hero_story_plague_doctor_ch5_text_3=sitting motionless at her desk, 
vo_hero_story_plague_doctor_ch5_text_4=paralyzed by the ceaseless wailing that reverberated in her mind.
vo_hero_story_grave_robber_ch1_slam_0=Grave Robber\nChapter One: Luxury's Lap
vo_hero_story_grave_robber_ch1_text_0=Born into money and married into more, she spent her days on horseback and her evenings in the ballroom.
vo_hero_story_grave_robber_ch1_text_1=She was the object of her husband's boorish lust and drunken temper,
vo_hero_story_grave_robber_ch1_text_2=placating his worst tendencies with a veneer of gracious deference.
vo_hero_story_grave_robber_ch1_text_3=All the while, indulging murderous fantasies of freedom...
vo_hero_story_grave_robber_ch1_text_4=and the fortune that would soon be hers.
vo_hero_story_grave_robber_ch2_slam_0=Chapter Two: Night Cap
vo_hero_story_grave_robber_ch2_fight_start_0=Night after night of disrespect and abuse - enough was enough.
vo_hero_story_grave_robber_ch2_fight_reward_0=She listened, smirking, as his empty apologies came in desperate, choking gags...
vo_hero_story_grave_robber_ch3_slam_0=Chapter Three: Embarrassment of Riches
vo_hero_story_grave_robber_ch3_text_0=Years of decadence and financial mismanagement had left the estate in staggering debt.
vo_hero_story_grave_robber_ch3_text_1=Humiliated and facing eviction, she wandered the empty halls,
vo_hero_story_grave_robber_ch3_text_2=hurling inebriated indignities at the portrait of the deceased,
vo_hero_story_grave_robber_ch3_text_3=whose hand had rested so possessively upon her shoulder.
vo_hero_story_grave_robber_ch3_text_4=A gleam of gold on that painted paw reminded her that his rings were unaccounted for...
vo_hero_story_grave_robber_ch3_text_5=... and must have been buried with him.
vo_hero_story_grave_robber_ch4_slam_0=Chapter Four: Filthy Rich
vo_hero_story_grave_robber_ch4_fight_start_0=To preserve her social standing, she would pilfer the rings from his fingers - the gold from his teeth!
vo_hero_story_grave_robber_ch4_fight_reward_0=She was awash in exhilaration, the glint in her eyes outshining the fistful of ill-gotten gains.
vo_hero_story_grave_robber_ch5_slam_0=Chapter Five: The Afterparty
vo_hero_story_grave_robber_ch5_text_0=Armed officials dispatched to oversee the eviction were shocked to find the front doors listlessly ajar.
vo_hero_story_grave_robber_ch5_text_1=The lavish carpets were lousy with dirt and leaves. 
vo_hero_story_grave_robber_ch5_text_2=A heap of heirlooms gleamed on the ballroom floor - rings and brooches in a careless pile. 
vo_hero_story_grave_robber_ch5_text_3=The lady of the manor, however... was nowhere to be found.
vo_hero_story_occultist_ch1_slam_0=Occultist\nChapter One: The Ritual
vo_hero_story_occultist_ch1_text_0=On certain portentous evenings carefully selected for their astrological potency,
vo_hero_story_occultist_ch1_text_1=he would gather his devotees around the ancient onyx table, and, joining hands with them,
vo_hero_story_occultist_ch1_text_2=would send his spirit out into the void. Safely tethered by their vital energies,
vo_hero_story_occultist_ch1_text_3=he was free to wander the Outer Spheres in search of some dark communion and impossible power.
vo_hero_story_occultist_ch2_slam_0=Chapter Two: A Door in the Desert
vo_hero_story_occultist_ch2_text_0=He found himself in a vast expanse of windswept dunes.
vo_hero_story_occultist_ch2_text_1=Ahead, the stone spires of a pyramidal temple called down jagged bolts from a roiling, angry sky.
vo_hero_story_occultist_ch2_text_2=Undaunted, he crossed the threshold of the towering aperture, settled himself upon the central dais,
vo_hero_story_occultist_ch2_text_3=and prepared for the coming sacrifice.
vo_hero_story_occultist_ch3_slam_0=Chapter Three: Some Parts Must Die
vo_hero_story_occultist_ch3_fight_start_0=Terrible though it was, he would pay the price for power!
vo_hero_story_occultist_ch3_fight_reward_0=The emptiness in him called out across boundless gulfs of unknown space...
vo_hero_story_occultist_ch3_fight_reward_1=... for nature abhors a vacuum.
vo_hero_story_occultist_ch4_slam_0=Chapter Four: The Guest
vo_hero_story_occultist_ch4_fight_start_0=Drawing vitality from the assembled mediums, 
vo_hero_story_occultist_ch4_fight_start_1=he would hold fast against the thing, and harness a portion of its power!
vo_hero_story_occultist_ch4_fight_reward_0=Imbued with strange currents of infernal origin, his apotheosis was complete...
vo_hero_story_occultist_ch5_slam_0=Chapter Five: An Eternal Flame
vo_hero_story_occultist_ch5_text_0=Emerging from his trance, he met the charred, steaming corpses of his acolytes with a shudder.
vo_hero_story_occultist_ch5_text_1=He could sense the eldritch entity stalking the edges of his consciousness, probing for weaknesses.
vo_hero_story_occultist_ch5_text_2=He had become a beacon - a conduit to unknown regions...
vo_hero_story_occultist_ch5_text_3=... and would be assailed by those blasphemous forces all the rest of his days.
vo_hero_story_leper_ch1_slam_0=Leper\nChapter One: Shun Them Not
vo_hero_story_leper_ch1_fight_start_0=Despite the protestations of his royal advisors, he would visit with the sick and dying,
vo_hero_story_leper_ch1_fight_start_1=providing them what comfort he could.
vo_hero_story_leper_ch1_fight_reward_0=The ailing and infirm were far less repulsive to him than the venomous whispers of his scoffing entourage...
vo_hero_story_leper_ch2_slam_0=Chapter Two: Infection
vo_hero_story_leper_ch2_text_0=Early signs could be ignored or concealed, but soon the reality was inescapable.
vo_hero_story_leper_ch2_text_1=Whether by some affliction of lineage or by direct transmission,
vo_hero_story_leper_ch2_text_2=symptoms of incurable disease began to openly manifest themselves.
vo_hero_story_leper_ch2_text_3=Wracked with pain, he summoned doctors and aides from the farthest reaches of his lands,
vo_hero_story_leper_ch2_text_4=all of whom concluded the worst: the King was dying.
vo_hero_story_leper_ch3_slam_0=Chapter Three: Treason
vo_hero_story_leper_ch3_text_0=Sedition, like any illness, spreads slowly.
vo_hero_story_leper_ch3_text_1=Rotten with a cynical opportunism born of longstanding entitlement,
vo_hero_story_leper_ch3_text_2=the scheming circle of advisors drafted mutinous plans.
vo_hero_story_leper_ch3_text_3=Though bedridden, he had long since divined their intent,
vo_hero_story_leper_ch3_text_4=and feared the disastrous results of their would-be rule.
vo_hero_story_leper_ch3_text_5=Summoning his blacksmith - and his strength - he hoisted his blade,
vo_hero_story_leper_ch3_text_6=and rose to meet the coming threat.
vo_hero_story_leper_ch4_slam_0=Chapter Four: The Purge
vo_hero_story_leper_ch4_fight_start_0=He had shown his compassion. Now... he would show his fury!
vo_hero_story_leper_ch4_fight_reward_0=His blade had broken, but so too the treasonous plot.
vo_hero_story_leper_ch5_slam_0=Chapter Five: A Beautiful View
vo_hero_story_leper_ch5_text_0=Satisfied that the spirit of his benevolent tenure would endure, he abdicated the throne.
vo_hero_story_leper_ch5_text_1=People gathered at windows and along the roads.
vo_hero_story_leper_ch5_text_2=Weeping, some threw petals at his feet, while others watched in reverent stoicism.
vo_hero_story_leper_ch5_text_3=As he walked beyond the city gates, he marveled at the beauty of the world,
vo_hero_story_leper_ch5_text_4=and was grateful for his many blessings.
vo_hero_story_hellion_ch1_slam_0=Hellion\nChapter One: The Eve of Glory
vo_hero_story_hellion_ch1_text_0=She was young to join the warband,
vo_hero_story_hellion_ch1_text_1=but any who challenged her readiness were met with clenched fists and violent indignation.
vo_hero_story_hellion_ch1_text_2=Having bloodied the last of her detractors, the matter was considered finally settled.
vo_hero_story_hellion_ch1_text_3=On the eve of battle, she joined her clanmates in a raucous celebration,
vo_hero_story_hellion_ch1_text_4=her stein and her spirits overflowing with abundance.
vo_hero_story_hellion_ch2_slam_0=Chapter Two: The Brave
vo_hero_story_hellion_ch2_fight_start_0=She was the tip of the spear - poised to sunder the enemy line,
vo_hero_story_hellion_ch2_fight_start_1=to live forever in the songs of her people!
vo_hero_story_hellion_ch2_fight_reward_0=Her entire life spent in preparation, but when it mattered most... she had failed.
vo_hero_story_hellion_ch3_slam_0=Chapter Three: Night in the Woods
vo_hero_story_hellion_ch3_text_0=As the advancing army moved on, she huddled tightly in the tree's clammy roots,
vo_hero_story_hellion_ch3_text_1=hoping to be somehow swallowed up into the earth.
vo_hero_story_hellion_ch3_text_2=At dawn, she woke tormented by the exuberant cries of carrion crows,
vo_hero_story_hellion_ch3_text_3=come to feast upon the corpses of her kin.
vo_hero_story_hellion_ch3_text_4=When at last she stirred, the scavengers took flight,
vo_hero_story_hellion_ch3_text_5=repulsed by the sight of this undeserving revenant.
vo_hero_story_hellion_ch4_slam_0=Chapter Four: Shame and Exile
vo_hero_story_hellion_ch4_fight_start_0=She had shunned a warrior's death, and her cowardice would be impugned!
vo_hero_story_hellion_ch4_fight_reward_0=They cast her out. An exile - unwelcome, and unsung.
vo_hero_story_hellion_ch5_slam_0=Chapter Five: The Great Emptiness
vo_hero_story_hellion_ch5_text_0=Alone and untethered, she wandered the countryside fighting for sport,
vo_hero_story_hellion_ch5_text_1=and soaking her wounds in wine. She sought death at every turn, 
vo_hero_story_hellion_ch5_text_2=desperate for a second chance to prove her mettle,
vo_hero_story_hellion_ch5_text_3=but it seemed even that terrible wraith had forsaken her.
vo_hero_story_hellion_ch5_text_4=Her isolation was absolute, her shame barely concealed by a fragile façade of fearlessness.
vo_hero_story_man_at_arms_ch1_slam_0=Man-at-Arms\nChapter One: A Premature Promotion
vo_hero_story_man_at_arms_ch1_text_0=The politics of a military career are perhaps as treacherous as war itself.
vo_hero_story_man_at_arms_ch1_text_1=Though untested in combat, his acumen for advancement was unmatched.
vo_hero_story_man_at_arms_ch1_text_2=Through a dubious campaign of influence and intimidation,
vo_hero_story_man_at_arms_ch1_text_3=he had at last claimed a coveted command,
vo_hero_story_man_at_arms_ch1_text_4=and was eager to bask in the glory of the victories that were sure to come.
vo_hero_story_man_at_arms_ch2_slam_0=Chapter Two: A Leader of Men
vo_hero_story_man_at_arms_ch2_fight_start_0=Behold the conquering General, marching his men to victory!
vo_hero_story_man_at_arms_ch2_fight_reward_0=A rout, a massacre... a complete and total failure of command.
vo_hero_story_man_at_arms_ch3_slam_0=Chapter Three: One Eye Open
vo_hero_story_man_at_arms_ch3_text_0=Every night, the men of his regiment would interrupt his fitful convalescence.
vo_hero_story_man_at_arms_ch3_text_1=Mutilated and maimed, the spectral garrison clawed at his bedcovers,
vo_hero_story_man_at_arms_ch3_text_2=whispering hateful truths in his ears.
vo_hero_story_man_at_arms_ch3_text_3=The exhausted attendants in the field hospital would wake to the sound of panicked screaming
vo_hero_story_man_at_arms_ch3_text_4=and inglorious sobs. It was not the war that had taken his eye. It was pride.
vo_hero_story_man_at_arms_ch4_slam_0=Chapter Four: Ghosts of the Past
vo_hero_story_man_at_arms_ch4_fight_start_0=Demoted and disgraced, he returned to the battlefield,
vo_hero_story_man_at_arms_ch4_fight_start_1=ready to endure the wrath of his regiment and grant them some small peace.
vo_hero_story_man_at_arms_ch4_fight_reward_0=At last, he would sleep undisturbed, and 
vo_hero_story_man_at_arms_ch4_fight_reward_1=perhaps find some comfort in that murky abyss of dreamless wonder.
vo_hero_story_man_at_arms_ch5_slam_0=Chapter Five: In the Trenches
vo_hero_story_man_at_arms_ch5_text_0=He resolved to spend his remaining years seeking atonement in the trenches of bloody battlefields the world over.
vo_hero_story_man_at_arms_ch5_text_1=For him, there could be no respite from the horrors of war.
vo_hero_story_man_at_arms_ch5_text_2=And when, at last, he was struck down, he would die alone and unremembered.
vo_hero_story_man_at_arms_ch5_text_3=Surely, he deserved no better.
vo_hero_story_jester_ch1_slam_0=Jester\nChapter One: Some Strange Melody
vo_hero_story_jester_ch1_text_0=He was a layabout without aspiration or purpose,
vo_hero_story_jester_ch1_text_1=content to loiter on street corners languidly busking for passersby.
vo_hero_story_jester_ch1_text_2=Roughly ushered from the bustling commercial blocks,
vo_hero_story_jester_ch1_text_3=he wandered the forgotten corners of the city. 
vo_hero_story_jester_ch1_text_4=An intoxicating melody drifted over a nearby cemetery wall,
vo_hero_story_jester_ch1_text_5=and he stumbled deliriously amongst the tombstones in search of the performer...
vo_hero_story_jester_ch2_slam_0=Chapter Two: Music of the Night
vo_hero_story_jester_ch2_fight_start_0=He could learn this unearthly hymn... and claim it as his own!
vo_hero_story_jester_ch2_fight_reward_0=Ambition, so long dormant within him, had been roused.
vo_hero_story_jester_ch2_fight_reward_1=He delighted in fantasies of fame, renown... and respect.
vo_hero_story_jester_ch3_slam_0=Chapter Three: Play to the Crowd
vo_hero_story_jester_ch3_text_0=When word of his uncommon talent reached the palace,
vo_hero_story_jester_ch3_text_1=he was summoned to entertain King and Court.
vo_hero_story_jester_ch3_text_2=Anticipating an historic performance and enthused adulation,
vo_hero_story_jester_ch3_text_3=he was stunned to find himself instead the object of their debased ridicule.
vo_hero_story_jester_ch3_text_4=While his noble audience dined drunkenly, he was mocked, tortured,
vo_hero_story_jester_ch3_text_5=and subjected to an obscene array of dangerous and decadent humiliations...
vo_hero_story_jester_ch4_slam_0=Chapter Four: A Dark Song
vo_hero_story_jester_ch4_fight_start_0=He unleashed his resentment upon instrument and crowd,
vo_hero_story_jester_ch4_fight_start_1=playing the demoniac melody with unrestrained fury!
vo_hero_story_jester_ch4_fight_reward_0=This was the song of the dead - and it had exacted a fitting tribute.
vo_hero_story_jester_ch5_slam_0=Chapter Five: Finale
vo_hero_story_jester_ch5_text_0=Bowing low, he basked in the echoing applause of dripping blood.
vo_hero_story_jester_ch5_text_1=The scene of wholesale dismemberment drove him to fits of mirthless hysterics.
vo_hero_story_jester_ch5_text_2=He was laughing still as he placed the blade against his own hand,
vo_hero_story_jester_ch5_text_3=severing his connection to whatever twisted talent he had so fleetingly enjoyed.
vo_hero_story_jester_ch5_text_4=Aimlessly, he drifted from the hall,
vo_hero_story_jester_ch5_text_5=humming broken bars of a discordant melody he could not quite remember...
vo_hero_story_runaway_ch1_slam_0=Runaway\nChapter One: The Pigs of St. Martha's
vo_hero_story_runaway_ch1_fight_start_0=Her pious caretakers had marked her for the last time.
vo_hero_story_runaway_ch1_fight_start_1=Tonight, she would escape their cruelty at last.
vo_hero_story_runaway_ch1_fight_reward_0=She ran blindly into the rain,
vo_hero_story_runaway_ch1_fight_reward_1=the squeals of the pursuing Sisters lost in the howling wind.
vo_hero_story_runaway_ch2_slam_0=Chapter Two: Beloved
vo_hero_story_runaway_ch2_text_0=Good fortune is a rare and wonderous thing.
vo_hero_story_runaway_ch2_text_1=She straggled from place to place, drenched and hungry,
vo_hero_story_runaway_ch2_text_2=until a kindly woodsman and his wife happened upon her.
vo_hero_story_runaway_ch2_text_3=Childless themselves, they welcomed her into their home,
vo_hero_story_runaway_ch2_text_4=where she warmed herself in the glow of their hearth and hearts.
vo_hero_story_runaway_ch3_slam_0=Chapter Three: Drawn to the Flame
vo_hero_story_runaway_ch3_text_0=She would stay up long into the night, tending the fire.
vo_hero_story_runaway_ch3_text_1=Captivated by its shifting hues, she thrilled to the eerie dance of spark and ember,
vo_hero_story_runaway_ch3_text_2=running her fingers absent-mindedly over the scars that patterned her arm.
vo_hero_story_runaway_ch3_text_3=The hearthlight seemed somehow alive, and in these private moments,
vo_hero_story_runaway_ch3_text_4=she yearned to reach out and be touched once again by its searing embrace.
vo_hero_story_runaway_ch4_slam_0=Chapter Four: Burnt Offering
vo_hero_story_runaway_ch4_fight_start_0=An accident, but surely there was time to contain the flames!
vo_hero_story_runaway_ch4_fight_reward_0=The walls were alight! There was no stopping it now...
vo_hero_story_runaway_ch5_slam_0=Chapter Five: Ashes
vo_hero_story_runaway_ch5_text_0=She stood in the center of the inferno, transfixed by its swirling, kaleidoscopic beauty...
vo_hero_story_runaway_ch5_text_1=Her rapturous fixation was cut short by a heavy beam falling from the ceiling, blocking the door.
vo_hero_story_runaway_ch5_text_2=Panicked, she dove headlong through a window as the cabin bloomed into a pyre.
vo_hero_story_runaway_ch5_text_3=Heaped upon the wet grass, she heard the screams of her adoptive parents...
vo_hero_story_runaway_ch5_text_4=... trapped and burning in their bedroom. 
vo_hero_story_vestal_ch1_slam_0=Vestal\nChapter One: Want Not
vo_hero_story_vestal_ch1_text_0=Together with her sisters, she tended the Order's sacred flame in pious humility.
vo_hero_story_vestal_ch1_text_1=The Abbey's austere arches and sanctified masonry afforded her a life of sheltered privilege
vo_hero_story_vestal_ch1_text_2=that few beyond the walls could imagine. Discipline was paramount, and
vo_hero_story_vestal_ch1_text_3=when forbidden desires would seek to distract her from monastic toil, she smothered them... reluctantly.
vo_hero_story_vestal_ch2_slam_0=Chapter Two: A Momentary Lapse
vo_hero_story_vestal_ch2_fight_start_0=She was a paragon of duty and virtue, but reminders of her deprivation were... everywhere.
vo_hero_story_vestal_ch2_fight_start_1=Surely, she deserved some indulgence for her labours!
vo_hero_story_vestal_ch2_fight_reward_0=Immersed in her reverie, she started violently at the piercing admonitions of
vo_hero_story_vestal_ch2_fight_reward_1=the furious Abbot.
vo_hero_story_vestal_ch3_slam_0=Chapter Three: No God but Men
vo_hero_story_vestal_ch3_text_0=Her terrified wails rang off the transepts as the Abbot dragged her to the oubliette.
vo_hero_story_vestal_ch3_text_1=As a deterrent to the congregation, her punishment would be more than commensurate with
vo_hero_story_vestal_ch3_text_2=her blasphemy. Locked interminably in the festering dark, she awaited retribution
vo_hero_story_vestal_ch3_text_3=from the divine while suffering the mortal tortures of its enraged servants.
vo_hero_story_vestal_ch4_slam_0=Chapter Four: Divine Intervention
vo_hero_story_vestal_ch4_fight_start_0=Vindication!  A golden ray beamed affirmation into the stagnant blackness of the dungeon.
vo_hero_story_vestal_ch4_fight_start_1=No divine punishment awaited her - it was her captors who had strayed from the Light!
vo_hero_story_vestal_ch4_fight_reward_0=Radiant with revelation, she stormed the stairs to the cloisters!
vo_hero_story_vestal_ch5_slam_0=Chapter Five: Wrath
vo_hero_story_vestal_ch5_text_0=Eager to share her emancipation with her convent, she rushed headlong toward the dormitory.
vo_hero_story_vestal_ch5_text_1=But where the chamber door once stood, she was met instead by a sheer wall of fresh masonry.
vo_hero_story_vestal_ch5_text_2=Her cries of jubilation died in her throat. From behind the drying mortar and sturdy stone
vo_hero_story_vestal_ch5_text_3=there came a feeble scratching, then her sisters' last piteous gasps.
vo_hero_story_vestal_ch5_text_4=The price of her wantonness would not be measured solely in blows from the flail...
vo_hero_story_flagellant_ch1_slam_0=Flagellant\nChapter One: Baptism
vo_hero_story_flagellant_ch1_text_0=He was a listless shade of the city, indifferent to his penury. With his skeletal build and
vo_hero_story_flagellant_ch1_text_1=bleeding gums, he looked an easy target for a pair of drunks seeking an outlet for their frustrations.
vo_hero_story_flagellant_ch1_text_2=The blows rained down, a tooth cracked - and a feverish crimson eclipsed his vision.
vo_hero_story_flagellant_ch1_text_3=In pain... there was power. He rose above his panting assailants, and, revelling in the marks
vo_hero_story_flagellant_ch1_text_4=of their sin, forgave them their trespasses.
vo_hero_story_flagellant_ch2_slam_0=Chapter Two: In Service of the Divine
vo_hero_story_flagellant_ch2_text_0=Drawn to the sombre depths of the church's oubliettes, he pledged his life to the clergy.
vo_hero_story_flagellant_ch2_text_1=There, he inflicted death by slow, delicious degrees - each crack of the lash an honour,
vo_hero_story_flagellant_ch2_text_2=a gift, a morbid sacrament. But his zeal proved too ardent, his brethren too timid -
vo_hero_story_flagellant_ch2_text_3=they cast him out, rendered him once more unto the streets.
vo_hero_story_flagellant_ch3_slam_0=Chapter Three: More, more!
vo_hero_story_flagellant_ch3_text_0=He roved out in search of torment, consuming the sin of any who would purge their misdeeds
vo_hero_story_flagellant_ch3_text_1=upon his body. Each wound fueled his fervour, the rapture only found in baptism by the lash.
vo_hero_story_flagellant_ch3_text_2=Drunk on his bloody intinctions, manic with the need for some elusive apotheosis,
vo_hero_story_flagellant_ch3_text_3=he gouged at himself without mercy. As blood poured from his rended flesh,
vo_hero_story_flagellant_ch3_text_4=his conciousness faltered, and the thundering hoofbeats of Death rang violent in his ears.
vo_hero_story_flagellant_ch4_slam_0=Chapter Four: Death's Door
vo_hero_story_flagellant_ch4_fight_start_0=Her scythe promised numbing obliviation - a premature end to his sacred journey of sensation!
vo_hero_story_flagellant_ch4_fight_reward_0=Gleaned from the world's gruesome delights, his power was enough to defy Death herself!

vo_cinematic_denial_0=Ruin has found you at last.
vo_cinematic_denial_1=My protégé - my friend - 
vo_cinematic_denial_2=our calculations were correct: the ephemeral equation is unbalanced.
vo_cinematic_denial_3=The earth spins on a strange and terrifying new axis,
vo_cinematic_denial_4=and everywhere... unbridled consequence.
vo_cinematic_denial_5=The world is a wasteland of failures past, and yet you must ride out into it, unafraid.
vo_cinematic_denial_6=Take this - it is Hope. The very last of it. It is yours now.
vo_cinematic_denial_7=You were bold once. Be bold once more.
vo_cinematic_denial_8=Free yourself from this suffocating stillness,
vo_cinematic_denial_9=fix your gaze on the horizon, and face the fearsome truth...
vo_cinematic_denial_10=...of the Darkest Dungeon.
vo_cinematics_denial_intro_01_0=I remember our first meeting on the steps of the University -
vo_cinematics_denial_intro_01_1=a collegial handshake that would doom us both.
vo_cinematics_denial_intro_01_2=Your insightful questions during my lectures gave me pause,
vo_cinematics_denial_intro_01_3=and I recognized in you something... of a kindred spirit. 
vo_cinematics_denial_intro_01_4=Despite our differences in age and position, 
vo_cinematics_denial_intro_01_5=we shared a keen fascination for archaeology, folklore, and of course, occultism.
vo_cinematics_denial_lore_01_0=Interminable faculty socials became something of a delight,
vo_cinematics_denial_lore_01_1=knowing we'd abscond to a quiet table
vo_cinematics_denial_lore_01_2=and lose ourselves in riveting discussion and passionate debate.
vo_cinematics_denial_lore_02_0=Commonalities between the mythos of ancient cultures was not a new area of study for either of us, 
vo_cinematics_denial_lore_02_1=but it was there that we first noticed the pattern.
vo_cinematics_denial_lore_03_0=We spent long nights immersed in crumbling, worm-eaten volumes,
vo_cinematics_denial_lore_03_1=plumbing the forbidden secrets of antiquity.
vo_cinematics_denial_lore_04_0=Between semesters, we would spend our days rambling the woods,
vo_cinematics_denial_lore_04_1=talking excitedly of esoteric theory and ancient mysteries...
vo_cinematics_denial_lore_05_0=The university's resources were impressive, and yet,
vo_cinematics_denial_lore_05_1=on occasion, we relished in... firsthand experience.
vo_cinematics_denial_lore_06_0=You were my brightest student, my research partner, and my dearest friend.
vo_cinematics_denial_outro_01_0=It was you who found the cypher, scribbled hastily in the decaying margins of some long-forgotten tome.
vo_cinematics_denial_outro_01_1=Scribbled...  in blood.
vo_cinematics_denial_outro_01_2=Whether by providence or happenstance, 
vo_cinematics_denial_outro_01_3=we stumbled upon the mark of some strange power invoked the world over,
vo_cinematics_denial_outro_01_4=reflected in cultures predating mankind itself. 
vo_cinematics_denial_outro_01_5=A semicircle, radiating five points of power - 
vo_cinematics_denial_outro_01_6=a symbol hidden deep in the iconography of every ancient empire... 
vo_cinematics_denial_outro_01_7=The Iron Crown - enigmatic and ubiquitous.
vo_cinematics_resentment_intro_01_0=Your vociferous calls to bring our findings before the faculty were dangerously premature.
vo_cinematics_resentment_intro_01_1=Given the gaps in our understanding, doing so would risk ridicule, or worse, robbery.
vo_cinematics_resentment_intro_01_2=I took no pleasure in asserting my seniority -
vo_cinematics_resentment_intro_01_3=stifling your protestations with a strict mandate of absolute secrecy.
vo_cinematics_resentment_intro_01_4=You acquiesced, but your plaintive susurrations betrayed a burgeoning resentment.
vo_cinematics_resentment_lore_01_0=We had managed to grasp a thread of connective worship -
vo_cinematics_resentment_lore_01_1=that stretched across vast gulfs of time and tribe.
vo_cinematics_resentment_lore_01_2=But we did not understand it.
vo_cinematics_resentment_lore_02_0=We required the highest standard of empirical evidence,
vo_cinematics_resentment_lore_02_1=lest my career and your future -
vo_cinematics_resentment_lore_02_2=- be compromised by the cynicism of our peers.
vo_cinematics_resentment_lore_03_0=Time and time again, I impressed upon you that any adulation afforded us
vo_cinematics_resentment_lore_03_1=would be fleeting if we could not properly defend our findings.
vo_cinematics_resentment_lore_04_0=I understood your eagerness to build a reputation,
vo_cinematics_resentment_lore_04_1=and it pained me greatly to hold you back.
vo_cinematics_resentment_lore_05_0=You mistook my abundance of caution for a lack of confidence,
vo_cinematics_resentment_lore_05_1=and would perseverate on your grievances at length...
vo_cinematics_resentment_lore_06_0=The subsequent months were measured in melted candles, 
vo_cinematics_resentment_lore_06_1=and mounting disappointments.
vo_cinematics_resentment_outro_01_0=The blaze began in the east wing of the Great Library.
vo_cinematics_resentment_outro_01_1=Within hours, the entirety of our effort lay in a smouldering, ashen heap.
vo_cinematics_resentment_outro_01_2=I braced against your rancorous buffeting,
vo_cinematics_resentment_outro_01_3=avowing a certain hesitant relief at our freedom from that mocking sigil.
vo_cinematics_resentment_outro_01_4=The uncanny arrival of the letter, however,
vo_cinematics_resentment_outro_01_5=heralded a new, pernicious phase of our investigation...
vo_cinematics_obsession_intro_01_0=We set out immediately into the kaleidoscopic wilds of the countryside,
vo_cinematics_obsession_intro_01_1=and by sundown, reached the remote manor whose whereabouts formed the sole contents of that cryptic invitation.
vo_cinematics_obsession_intro_01_2=At the behest of our charismatic host, we feasted beneath a banner of the Iron Crown; 
vo_cinematics_obsession_intro_01_3=questioned exhaustively by an eager cabal of masked delegates.
vo_cinematics_obsession_lore_01_0=Our host assured us of the group's anthropological values,
vo_cinematics_obsession_lore_01_1=but I sensed his designs extended well beyond the theoretical.
vo_cinematics_obsession_lore_02_0=The house was scattered with ancient rarities and timeworn artifacts -
vo_cinematics_obsession_lore_02_1=all bearing that damnable emblem that had come to dominate our thoughts.
vo_cinematics_obsession_lore_03_0=Eyes wild beneath their masks, the assembled devotees
vo_cinematics_obsession_lore_03_1=shared their terrible theories of timeless extradimensional intelligences -
vo_cinematics_obsession_lore_03_2=of forces beyond human comprehension...
vo_cinematics_obsession_lore_04_0=As the night wore on, circles were drawn carefully in chalk, and salt was laid upon the floor.
vo_cinematics_obsession_lore_04_1=This was not research, it was ritual.
vo_cinematics_obsession_lore_04_2=And I could not stifle my repulsion.
vo_cinematics_obsession_lore_05_0=They lit black candles and chanted rhythmically in the gutteral tongues of long-forgotten tribes.
vo_cinematics_obsession_lore_05_1=Even now, I can hear the echoes of those awful invocations.
vo_cinematics_obsession_lore_06_0=At my insistence, we retired to our room,
vo_cinematics_obsession_lore_06_1=where I countered your excitement by clearly outlining the vulnerability of our position.
vo_cinematics_obsession_lore_06_2=Reason prevailed, and we elected to block the door with a large dresser.
vo_cinematics_obsession_outro_01_0=We awoke to an empty house.
vo_cinematics_obsession_outro_01_1=The garroted bodies of the attendees lay around the basement dais,
vo_cinematics_obsession_outro_01_2=each prostrate along a point of the Crown; our host conspicuously absent.
vo_cinematics_obsession_outro_01_3=I could scarcely countenance such obscenity,
vo_cinematics_obsession_outro_01_4=but you were transfixed, eyes ablaze with inspiration.
vo_cinematics_obsession_outro_01_5=The failed ritual would become your obsession -
vo_cinematics_obsession_outro_01_6=from that pivotal moment, you were blind to all else.
vo_cinematics_ambition_intro_01_0=Refusing enrollment in the fall, you took up in that mouldering brownstone,
vo_cinematics_ambition_intro_01_1=where I joined you in a vain attempt to assuage your aspirations.
vo_cinematics_ambition_intro_01_2=Now free from academic oversight and moral restraint, you vowed to reach into the blackest depths...
vo_cinematics_ambition_intro_01_3=...of the occult sciences and be the first to grasp the secret of the Iron Crown.
vo_cinematics_ambition_intro_01_4=The polarity between us reversed - I became your reluctant assistant in dozens of deplorable experiments,
vo_cinematics_ambition_intro_01_5=...crushed in the grip of your ambition.
vo_cinematics_ambition_lore_01_0=You calibrated prisms along the points of the Crown, cackling in smug satisfaction 
vo_cinematics_ambition_lore_01_1=as wavelengths of hideous and indescribable light burned our eyes.
vo_cinematics_ambition_lore_02_0=You attempted to map the geometric proportions of the Crown to frequencies of sound, 
vo_cinematics_ambition_lore_02_1=and in the resulting silence, our ears welled with blood.
vo_cinematics_ambition_lore_03_0=At night I could hear you shuffling about the house, muttering with diabolic intent.
vo_cinematics_ambition_lore_04_0=The walls of the place closed tight about us,
vo_cinematics_ambition_lore_04_1=and it seemed at times that the outside world was a dream we could scarcely remember.
vo_cinematics_ambition_lore_05_0=Desperate to somehow help you regain yourself, I prepared a breakfast, and an urgent appeal.
vo_cinematics_ambition_lore_05_1= My words fell on deaf ears; the food flung to the floor.
vo_cinematics_ambition_lore_05_2=Your appetites demanded more than I could hope to provide.
vo_cinematics_ambition_lore_06_0=The Crown was a hateful and ravenous thing - it had consumed our careers, our lives,
vo_cinematics_ambition_lore_06_1=...and our friendship. And still, it hungered...
vo_cinematics_ambition_outro_01_0=Unable to suffer your unprincipled overreach any longer, I made ready to depart;
vo_cinematics_ambition_outro_01_1=imploring you to rejoin me in more wholesome pursuits.
vo_cinematics_ambition_outro_01_2=Instead, you babbled of impossible measurements, ushering me down into the bolted cellar. 
vo_cinematics_ambition_outro_01_3=In the dim light, I recoiled at the preparations you had made.
vo_cinematics_ambition_outro_01_4=Four bodies, laid out along the lateral points of the Crown.
vo_cinematics_ambition_outro_01_5=As the dagger's blade revealed itself through my chest, I understood <i>I</i> was to be the fifth.
vo_cinematics_cowardice_intro_01_0=A precise arrangement, the sacrifice of conscience, the abandonment of self... 
vo_cinematics_cowardice_intro_01_1=the Iron Crown had found its king.  Upon your furrowed brow,
vo_cinematics_cowardice_intro_01_2=...the mathematics of our existence, the geometry of the cosmos -
vo_cinematics_cowardice_intro_01_3=- an ephemeral equation wholly expressed in negative space.
vo_cinematics_cowardice_intro_01_4=To invoke its power was to refactor the most fundamental underpinnings of our fragile dimension,
vo_cinematics_cowardice_intro_01_5=...to imprint one's mind upon reality itself...
vo_cinematics_cowardice_lore_01_0=The wind blew sour, the oceans roiled.  The earth shuddered at the coming change.
vo_cinematics_cowardice_lore_02_0=What world could be born of a mind so sharpened by appetence? 
vo_cinematics_cowardice_lore_03_0=Mankind became a mockery - his newly horrid outlines a twisted tribute to the shape of your flaws.
vo_cinematics_cowardice_lore_04_0=Newborn horrors, spawn of the crown, imprinted with your insatiable, reaching hunger.
vo_cinematics_cowardice_lore_05_0=Our world convulses, stretched and torn by the emptiness that surrounds it.
vo_cinematics_cowardice_lore_06_0=This existential dissolution is born of you, and only you can do what must be done to stop it.
vo_cinematics_cowardice_inkfire_01_0=Here, at the nexus of ruin, loathing poured forth from the darkest recesses of your mind.
vo_cinematics_cowardice_inkfire_01_1=Your failures took form, and the world bowed in honour of your great wretchedness.
vo_cinematics_cowardice_inkfire_01_2=The stain of your bankruptcy frayed the very fabric of our dimension.
vo_cinematics_cowardice_inkfire_01_3=But you were afraid to face what you had wrought, and fled down the long road of your memories.
vo_cinematics_cowardice_inkfire_01_4=Hiding yourself away. 
vo_cinematics_cowardice_inkfire_02_0=I remember our first meeting on the steps of the University... You were golden,
vo_cinematics_cowardice_inkfire_02_1=...lit from within by the glow of potential.  Finally, my friend,
vo_cinematics_cowardice_inkfire_02_2=...I would see that potential realized. It is time to reclaim the world from your weakness.
vo_cinematics_cowardice_inkfire_02_3=Meet your derelictions with blazing defiance! The Equation must be balanced.
vo_cinematics_cowardice_approach_01_0=Gaze now upon your great achievement - the sumtotal of your failings.  Your Body of Work.
vo_cinematics_final_cinematic_01_0=Your confession is complete. The cosmic axes are aligned once more.
vo_cinematics_final_cinematic_01_1=Forgive yourself.
vo_cinematics_final_cinematic_01_2=Humanity is a weak hypothesis, after all.
vo_cinematics_final_cinematic_01_3=An unbalanced equation... an imperfect angle.
vo_cinematics_final_cinematic_01_4=We sow the seeds of our ruin, and seek to deny its reckoning.
vo_cinematics_final_cinematic_01_5=We make mountains of our mistakes, monsters of our misdeeds.
vo_cinematics_final_cinematic_01_6=We slip and stumble, we fail and we falter.
vo_cinematics_final_cinematic_01_7=And yet, in each of us, a hopeful light,
vo_cinematics_final_cinematic_01_8=holding fast against the hellish shadows that gather between our good intentions.
vo_cinematics_final_cinematic_01_9=And in each of us, the limitless emptiness...
vo_cinematics_final_cinematic_01_10=...of a Darkest Dungeon.
