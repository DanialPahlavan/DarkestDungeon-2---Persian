story_bark_assist_torch_lowtorch_1+grave_robber=They could have news of the cities...
story_bark_assist_torch_lowtorch_1+jester=A relief, seeing regular folk outside.
story_bark_assist_torch_lowtorch_1+hellion=These folk are not yet bent by the enemy!
story_bark_assist_torch_lowtorch_1+bounty_hunter=Hmph. Fine.
story_bark_assist_torch_lowtorch_1+runaway=We don't have <i>hours</i> to waste, but...

story_bark_assist_combat_items_1+occultist=We should aid any who forestall the abyss.
story_bark_assist_combat_items_1+plague_doctor=Tinctures? Powders? Shall we swap?
story_bark_assist_combat_items_1+grave_robber=Oh, look at you scrappy things. Need a hand?
story_bark_assist_combat_items_1+jester=They are either insane or an inspiration.
story_bark_assist_combat_items_1+hellion=Such fighting spirit! I lend you my arm.
story_bark_assist_combat_items_1+bounty_hunter=There's fight in these folks yet.
story_bark_assist_combat_items_1+runaway=We can help if you make it worth our while.
story_bark_assist_combat_items_1+leper=The herds on the plains know strength in numbers.

story_bark_assist_inn_items_1+plague_doctor=Their stores might hold rarities we lack.
story_bark_assist_inn_items_1+grave_robber=Mm, is that tea I smell? See what they've got.
story_bark_assist_inn_items_1+jester=The timbre of full barrels better suits the song I'm writing.
story_bark_assist_inn_items_1+hellion=If they have whiskey, I have time!
story_bark_assist_inn_items_1+bounty_hunter=If they're paying...
story_bark_assist_inn_items_1+runaway=We'll eat better tonight if we help 'em.

story_bark_assist_repair_wheels_1+occultist=We must pace ourselves <i>and</i> the coach.
story_bark_assist_repair_wheels_1+plague_doctor=These wretched wheels! Pity's sake, fix them!

story_bark_assist_repair_wheels_1+flagellant=The wheels are in splinters! Put them to work!
story_bark_assist_scout_1+highwayman=I reckon they know the lay of the land.
story_bark_assist_scout_1+man_at_arms=Any intelligence is good intelligence out here.
story_bark_assist_scout_1+occultist=They may have travelled where my scrying cannot.
story_bark_assist_scout_1+plague_doctor=What grows out here? Can you tell us?
story_bark_assist_scout_1+grave_robber=That one has the look of a fellow ne'erdowell.
story_bark_assist_scout_1+jester=They'd know the back roads as well as any.
story_bark_assist_scout_1+hellion=Tell me, peasants! Any sign of ambush?!
story_bark_assist_scout_1+bounty_hunter=Get 'em talking.
story_bark_assist_scout_1+runaway=There's a side route through anything. And they'll know it.
story_bark_assist_scout_1+leper=Ask not the crow what lies under the sea. Ask the osprey.
story_bark_assist_scout_1+vestal=Commonfolk always gossip - let us listen.
story_bark_assist_scout_1+flagellant=Gather round! Confess your secrets.
story_bark_assist_inspire_1+highwayman=Out here, folks need hope more than anything.
story_bark_assist_inspire_1+man_at_arms=I may not be some hero of legend, but...
story_bark_assist_inspire_1+occultist=The night is lonely and long - come, join us at the fire.
story_bark_assist_inspire_1+plague_doctor=Hrm! I hear one coughing. This way, whelp!
story_bark_assist_inspire_1+grave_robber=They get by on so little. It astounds me!
story_bark_assist_inspire_1+jester=Fetch the drums and tambourine!
story_bark_assist_inspire_1+hellion=So many orphaned, so many maimed...

story_bark_assist_inspire_2+highwayman=We can't leave them in this state...
story_bark_assist_inspire_2+man_at_arms=Let us share tales of our victories!
story_bark_assist_inspire_2+occultist=They might take comfort in our morbid trophies.
story_bark_assist_inspire_2+plague_doctor=Humans tend to exude positive airs in brighter climes.
story_bark_assist_inspire_2+grave_robber=A scandalous story or two? Ehm, the ones with good endings.
story_bark_assist_inspire_2+jester=I do miss juggling, if not scorching my fingers.
story_bark_assist_inspire_2+hellion=Hope is like mead - best when shared!
story_bark_assist_inspire_2+bounty_hunter=Fine. If we must.
story_bark_assist_inspire_2+runaway=Tend a tiny spark, and soon your hearth is warm.
story_bark_assist_inspire_2+leper=It is no coincidence they gather already 'round a fire.
story_bark_assist_inspire_2+vestal=Feel that - the Flame calls to us!
story_bark_assist_inspire_2+flagellant=Mine is a holy cause - join me, you rabble!
story_bark_assist_inspire_3+highwayman=It's a bleak world. Poor blighters.
story_bark_assist_inspire_3+man_at_arms=It falls on us to replenish their spirits!
story_bark_assist_inspire_3+occultist=From modest action can come great consequence.
story_bark_assist_inspire_3+plague_doctor=Great fires require very little fuel to start.
story_bark_assist_inspire_3+grave_robber=I was close to walking in their grubby little boots, myself.
story_bark_assist_inspire_3+jester=I was built for this! Lemme show you.
story_bark_assist_inspire_3+hellion=I am tired. But... we ought to.
story_bark_assist_inspire_3+bounty_hunter=Be foolish not to if they're paying.
story_bark_assist_inspire_3+runaway=When the flame's low, that's when they need us most...
story_bark_assist_inspire_3+leper=Show mercy, even when it benefits us least.
story_bark_assist_inspire_3+vestal=Any infirm among their number?
story_bark_assist_inspire_3+flagellant=The sun draws low! Gather at my feet!
story_bark_assist_inspire_4+highwayman=Let's roll up our sleeves, then.
story_bark_assist_inspire_4+man_at_arms=Sick oxen, listing wagons - let's lend an arm.
story_bark_assist_inspire_4+occultist=We need not <i>only</i> help with our knives.
story_bark_assist_inspire_4+plague_doctor=Their wagon is in disrepair - we've the know-how!
story_bark_assist_inspire_4+grave_robber=Eugh. Mud, packbeasts, squabbling children...
story_bark_assist_inspire_4+jester=I'll beat the drum, you do the pushing!
story_bark_assist_inspire_4+hellion=I could likely do this single-handed!
story_bark_assist_inspire_4+bounty_hunter=Let's push.
story_bark_assist_inspire_4+runaway=All right! On three! One... two...
story_bark_assist_inspire_4+leper=Fate has put them in our path for a reason.
story_bark_assist_inspire_4+vestal=The Light led us to these poor souls.
story_bark_assist_inspire_4+flagellant=Split your knuckles! Free yourself of sin!
story_bark_assist_inspire_5+highwayman=They're building a camp, looks like.
story_bark_assist_inspire_5+man_at_arms=I know a thing or two about fortifications...
story_bark_assist_inspire_5+occultist=We could even cook for them - what say you?
story_bark_assist_inspire_5+plague_doctor=Always a humerus in need of splinting...
story_bark_assist_inspire_5+grave_robber=I've some baubles that might entertain the wee sprats.
story_bark_assist_inspire_5+jester=It's been some time since I played for a crowd...
story_bark_assist_inspire_5+hellion=Which of you weaklings will tire first? 
story_bark_assist_inspire_5+bounty_hunter=*sigh*
story_bark_assist_inspire_5+runaway=We gotta watch out for one another.
story_bark_assist_inspire_5+leper=A less bombast calling, but equally noble.
story_bark_assist_inspire_5+vestal=How fortunate for them we happened by!
story_bark_assist_inspire_5+flagellant=You have greater need of us than you know!
story_bark_assist_donate_1+highwayman=Feels better to help folks than rob 'em.
story_bark_assist_donate_1+man_at_arms=We are comfortable - let's ease their burden.
story_bark_assist_donate_1+occultist=Our gold makes more difference out here than in our coffers.
story_bark_assist_donate_1+plague_doctor=Currency will be rendered useless if we fail!
story_bark_assist_donate_1+grave_robber=Our relics? Is that what they desire? ... So be it.
story_bark_assist_donate_1+jester=Few sing the praises of relics over men.
story_bark_assist_donate_1+hellion=I prefer not to attract bandits!
story_bark_assist_donate_1+bounty_hunter=I prefer coin anyhow.
story_bark_assist_donate_1+runaway=Can't buy hope with trinkets.
story_bark_assist_donate_1+leper=Charity lightens the soul's burden.
story_bark_assist_donate_1+vestal=I've no doubt the Light shall repay us.
story_bark_assist_donate_1+flagellant=What use have I for baubles?
story_bark_assist_donate_2+highwayman=We're a jingling target - we can spare some loot.
story_bark_assist_donate_2+man_at_arms=They need relics, we need resupply.
story_bark_assist_donate_2+occultist=Ointments, powder, better use to us than relics.
story_bark_assist_donate_2+plague_doctor=What good are baubles if we bleed out?
story_bark_assist_donate_2+grave_robber=Ugh, fine. But only the semiprecious stones.
story_bark_assist_donate_2+jester=How novel, charity.
story_bark_assist_donate_2+hellion=These trinkets only weigh us down.
story_bark_assist_donate_2+bounty_hunter=Heh. Seems fair.
story_bark_assist_donate_2+runaway=We should be traveling lighter anyhow.
story_bark_assist_donate_2+leper=Gold matters not where we are headed.
story_bark_assist_donate_2+vestal=Our mission is paramount - this will help.
story_bark_assist_donate_2+flagellant=They can have the lot of it, if you ask me.
story_bark_assist_donate_3+highwayman=Spare our wheels the excess weight.
story_bark_assist_donate_3+man_at_arms=Expensive work, outfittin' a militia!
story_bark_assist_donate_3+occultist=There was a time I'd have clung to my finery...
story_bark_assist_donate_3+plague_doctor=I only require enough silver for my alchemies.
story_bark_assist_donate_3+grave_robber=Must you all stare at me? ... Fine. We'll share.
story_bark_assist_donate_3+jester=Here. This coin's lucky - yours now.
story_bark_assist_donate_3+hellion=Perhaps they'll repay us later.
story_bark_assist_donate_3+bounty_hunter=Do as you will. I got my share already.
story_bark_assist_donate_3+runaway=There's more useful things than these weird old bits.
story_bark_assist_donate_3+leper=Precious metals, yes, but also memories.
story_bark_assist_donate_3+vestal=Hold-me-ons from a prior life...
story_bark_assist_donate_3+flagellant=Riches hold no sway over me.
story_bark_assist_donate_4+highwayman=The longer we're at this, the less the loot matters.
story_bark_assist_donate_4+man_at_arms=My ol' first sergeant once gifted me a whetstone...
story_bark_assist_donate_4+occultist=Wise is the man who spends his last coin on another.
story_bark_assist_donate_4+plague_doctor=Many of my most beloved cadavers were donations.
story_bark_assist_donate_4+grave_robber=I'm saving the finer pieces but go on, take the rest.
story_bark_assist_donate_4+jester=A patron once gifted me a chalice. Turned out he'd stolen it.
story_bark_assist_donate_4+hellion=We have the wealth that matters: food, warmth, and furs!
story_bark_assist_donate_4+bounty_hunter=No. You can't have that. Or that.
story_bark_assist_donate_4+runaway=Why hoard what we have?
story_bark_assist_donate_4+leper=A pittance for us, lifechanging for them.
story_bark_assist_donate_4+vestal=As vital a part of our mission as our blades.
story_bark_assist_donate_4+flagellant=If there be some benefit to us - do it!
story_bark_assist_donate_5+highwayman=Someone gave me a bag of plums, once. I ate like a king.
story_bark_assist_donate_5+man_at_arms=Come, friends - this is an easy choice!
story_bark_assist_donate_5+occultist=This scarf was lent to me when I fell on hard times.
story_bark_assist_donate_5+plague_doctor=Fewer relics, more room for specimens.
story_bark_assist_donate_5+grave_robber=Once, I loathed my sisters' hand-me-downs. Now I miss them so...
story_bark_assist_donate_5+jester=I won't even make them dance for it.
story_bark_assist_donate_5+hellion=A knife, from the antler of the first stag I felled as a girl.
story_bark_assist_donate_5+bounty_hunter=Long as it ain't coming out of my pay.
story_bark_assist_donate_5+runaway=Everything I owned was alms once.
story_bark_assist_donate_5+leper=Perhaps I overcompensate for having never known hunger.
story_bark_assist_donate_5+vestal=A sister of mine... she painted this scroll for me.
story_bark_assist_donate_5+flagellant=The most precious gift I can offer them - pain!
story_bark_assist_stealfood_101+highwayman=If we starve, this whole journey is for naught.
story_bark_assist_stealfood_101+man_at_arms=Scruples are the first casualty of war.
story_bark_assist_stealfood_101+occultist=If you do not feed me, it will.
story_bark_assist_stealfood_101+plague_doctor=No laws govern us but the law of force!
story_bark_assist_stealfood_101+grave_robber=They feast on mutton while we eat slime!
story_bark_assist_stealfood_101+jester=Better to steal from kings, but I'm <i>hungry.</i>
story_bark_assist_stealfood_101+hellion=If they cannot defend it, they shouldn't have it!
story_bark_assist_stealfood_101+bounty_hunter=If we don't survive this, who will?
story_bark_assist_stealfood_101+runaway=We'll help <i>everyone</i> better when not hunger-weak.
story_bark_assist_stealfood_101+leper=I am so often a shepherd, but hunger is the wolf.
story_bark_assist_stealfood_101+vestal=Our holy purpose surpasses their needs!
story_bark_assist_stealfood_101+flagellant=Abandon our work so some beggar stays fed?
story_bark_assist_stealrelics_101+highwayman=This pistol is loaded.
story_bark_assist_stealrelics_101+man_at_arms=Give us your relics and flee with your lives!
story_bark_assist_stealrelics_101+occultist=This is not a gamble you will win. Hands up.
story_bark_assist_stealrelics_101+plague_doctor=We have need of your wealth! No questions!
story_bark_assist_stealrelics_101+grave_robber=I've no qualms with planting a knife 'tween the shoulders.
story_bark_assist_stealrelics_101+jester=Relics. Gold. Silver. Give it here.
story_bark_assist_stealrelics_101+hellion=I'll be taking that!
story_bark_assist_stealrelics_101+bounty_hunter=Don't make me use the hook.
story_bark_assist_stealrelics_101+runaway=I'm not leaving empty-handed.
story_bark_assist_stealrelics_101+leper=Desperation makes monsters.
story_bark_assist_stealrelics_101+vestal=Our works are <i>more</i> necessary.
story_bark_assist_stealrelics_101+flagellant=Come, now. Just look at me. Hand it over.
story_bark_assist_avoid_101+highwayman=An inconvenience, they are.
story_bark_assist_avoid_101+man_at_arms=Inefficient and tactically unwise.
story_bark_assist_avoid_101+occultist=I sense misfortune coming if we linger here.
story_bark_assist_avoid_101+plague_doctor=My studies do not spare me the luxury of time.
story_bark_assist_avoid_101+grave_robber=Dearie me, they will simply have to survive.
story_bark_assist_avoid_101+jester=No, no! I'm inspired! I must write!
story_bark_assist_avoid_101+hellion=No blood, no thunder.
story_bark_assist_avoid_101+bounty_hunter=And risk an ambush? No.
story_bark_assist_avoid_101+runaway=We can't afford to slow down for this...!
story_bark_assist_avoid_101+leper=Fate has not granted me enough hours for this diversion.
story_bark_assist_avoid_101+vestal=Our aim is clear - let us not divert.
story_bark_assist_avoid_101+flagellant=The poor sinners will survive without us.
story_bark_assist_ascetic_1=I hear great wealth brings great curses in these times.
story_bark_assist_ascetic_1+flagellant=I count my wealth in scars, not relics.
story_bark_assist_austere_1=Wealth is but a distraction - let's away with it.
story_bark_assist_austere_1+flagellant=Mere shiny annoyances. Off with them!
story_bark_assist_bloodthirsty_1=Let's leave only bloody footprints.
story_bark_assist_boisterous_1=Who better than us to help? We are great at this.
story_bark_assist_chatterbox_1=You'd hardly believe our luck on this voyage...
story_bark_assist_chatterbox_1+flagellant=Come, come! It has been some time since my recitations...
story_bark_assist_city_scrounger_1=Surely some useful items can be found if we look hard.
story_bark_assist_city_scrounger_1+flagellant=Come, come! It has been some time since my recitations...
story_bark_assist_compassionate_1+highwayman=I've been that hungry once.
story_bark_assist_compassionate_1+man_at_arms=Let this world not make monsters of us, eh?
story_bark_assist_compassionate_1+occultist=I have not lost my humanity. They need us.
story_bark_assist_compassionate_1+plague_doctor=All I have learned was so that I might give aid.
story_bark_assist_compassionate_1+grave_robber=Now that I have gone without, my heart aches for them.
story_bark_assist_compassionate_1+jester=Poor little sods. 
story_bark_assist_compassionate_1+hellion=For too long I shunned the weak...
story_bark_assist_compassionate_1+bounty_hunter=Suppose I'm bein' well paid.
story_bark_assist_compassionate_1+runaway=Just 'cause we suffered don't mean they should.
story_bark_assist_compassionate_1+leper=I will take nothing with me to the next world.
story_bark_assist_compassionate_1+vestal=It wounds my heart to see them suffer so.
story_bark_assist_compassionate_1+flagellant=We can give them glories greater than gold!
story_bark_assist_curmudgeon_1+highwayman=Why? They never thank us.
story_bark_assist_curmudgeon_1+man_at_arms=Good-for-nothing complainers to a man!
story_bark_assist_curmudgeon_1+occultist=They always beg our help - and for what?
story_bark_assist_curmudgeon_1+plague_doctor=Nothing good ever comes from these wretches.
story_bark_assist_curmudgeon_1+grave_robber=Call me petty, but I've known penury. They'll live.
story_bark_assist_curmudgeon_1+jester=Abject bores, the lot of them.
story_bark_assist_curmudgeon_1+hellion=They are not of my blood! Why should I?
story_bark_assist_curmudgeon_1+bounty_hunter=Let's just go.
story_bark_assist_curmudgeon_1+runaway=Where were the bleeding hearts when <i>I</i> scavenged the streets?
story_bark_assist_curmudgeon_1+leper=If we aid them, they may in time use it against us.
story_bark_assist_curmudgeon_1+vestal=I'm inclined to decline.
story_bark_assist_curmudgeon_1+flagellant=Their plight moves me not. Onward.
story_bark_assist_dark_curiosity_1=What if... we just left them to their own fates.
story_bark_assist_devout_1=We must help. It is our sacred duty.
story_bark_assist_doomsayer_1=Their fate is already sealed. And it's not a happy one.

story_bark_assist_greed_stealfood_1+man_at_arms=We need strength for battles ahead - raid their pantry!
story_bark_assist_greed_stealfood_1+occultist=I have slain a man for a waterskin once before.
