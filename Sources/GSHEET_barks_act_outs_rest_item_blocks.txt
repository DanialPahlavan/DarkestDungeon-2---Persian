bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+suspicious=And why should I?
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+suspicious=Leave me be.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+suspicious+highwayman=Not sure about that.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+suspicious+highwayman=Just what are you trying to pull? No.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+suspicious+man_at_arms=What would you gain by that, eh?
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+suspicious+man_at_arms=Leave an old man to his rest.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+suspicious+grave_robber=I decline. Hands to yourself, <i>friend.</i>
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+suspicious+grave_robber=I am skeptical of your noble intentions. Never.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+suspicious+plague_doctor=You've designs against me, I'm certain.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+suspicious+plague_doctor=You're trying to get at my notes, aren't you?
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+suspicious+occultist=You seek some advantage, no doubt. Pass.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+suspicious+occultist=We - ahem, I - have a bad feeling about you.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+suspicious+jester=And let you near my tender bits? Hmm. Nah.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+suspicious+jester=I know a scoundrel when I see one. No.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+suspicious+leper=Perhaps when you've proven trustworthy.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+suspicious+leper=Mountains are neither formed nor eroded in a day.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+suspicious+hellion=You seek some edge over me, I'm sure.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+suspicious+hellion=Work your tricks on someone else.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+suspicious+runaway=Keep your distance. 
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+suspicious+runaway=You're overeager. Let me rest. Go.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+envious+highwayman=You'd love that, I'm sure.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+envious+highwayman=Let me cut you off there - no.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+envious+man_at_arms=Oh, to be so untroubled.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+envious+man_at_arms=What's that? <i>Now</i> you need me? Hmph.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+envious+grave_robber=I'm to clamour for <i>your</i> favour, am I?
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+envious+grave_robber=Surely one so favoured doesn't need my help.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+envious+plague_doctor=You seem comfortable enough without me.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+envious+plague_doctor=I'll only get in your way, I'm sure.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+envious+occultist=I am content where I sit, thank you.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+envious+occultist=You disrupt the energy of this place. Leave me.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+envious+jester=And rain on your parade? Hardly.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+envious+jester=I'll let you play this one solo.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+envious+leper=You clearly do not require my assistance.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+envious+leper=You seek glory. I seek rest. Move on.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+envious+hellion=You're faring fine without me, lickspit.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+envious+hellion=You lean on me enough. Handle this yourself.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+envious+runaway=Must be swell, ordering us around.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+envious+runaway=Hmm... nah.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+resentful+highwayman=Who died and made you king?
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+resentful+highwayman=My plans tonight do not involve you.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+resentful+man_at_arms=Respect the chain of command and shove off.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+resentful+man_at_arms=That's a crack-up! No, no.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+resentful+grave_robber=You come crawling to me for company <i>now?</i>
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+resentful+grave_robber=I'd sooner scrub plates.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+resentful+plague_doctor=Your presence is an insult.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+resentful+plague_doctor=Need I be more direct? Shoo!
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+resentful+occultist=I've no patience for fair-weather allies.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+resentful+occultist=Your presence drains my psyche.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+resentful+jester=Joyless pisspot, you are.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+resentful+jester=Aaahaha! Good one. No.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+resentful+leper=You rouse me from my meditations for this?
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+resentful+leper=I can think of little that would please me less.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+resentful+hellion=I don't like that look in your eye.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+resentful+hellion=You reek of ill will. 
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+resentful+runaway=I don't need you. Back off.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+resentful+runaway=What did I do to deserve all this bother? Ugh.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+hateful+highwayman=I'd sooner tie my own noose.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+hateful+highwayman=Keep your distance if you know what's good for you.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+hateful+man_at_arms=You're a waste of good rations.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+hateful+man_at_arms=I'm tired. You exhaust me further. Git.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+hateful+grave_robber=Hahah! ... Oh dear, you were serious?
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+hateful+grave_robber=I know a scoundrel when I see one. Take your leave.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+hateful+plague_doctor=Keep your distance!
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+hateful+plague_doctor=Eugh. I hold you in the strongest of contempt.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+hateful+occultist=You were born under a bad moon. Begone.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+hateful+occultist=Your presence offends me.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+hateful+jester=I dreamt you kicked the bucket. Heheh.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+hateful+jester=Regretfully, just recalled I have... a thing to go do.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+hateful+leper=You only draw breath as you are beneath my contempt.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+hateful+leper=Press me not, lest you rouse my ire.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+hateful+hellion=Or better yet, we pack up and leave you here.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+hateful+hellion=*snarl*
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+hateful+runaway=Bother someone else. <i>Anyone</i> else.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+hateful+runaway=Not anyone, but especially not you.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+tumultuous+highwayman=Do you even know how to hold that thing?
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+tumultuous+highwayman=My patience for your games is waning.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+tumultuous+man_at_arms=Greenhorn.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+tumultuous+man_at_arms=We haven't the time for this malarkey.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+tumultuous+grave_robber=You commit the worst sin of all, love - you bore me.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+tumultuous+grave_robber=Go sulk at someone else, poppet.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+tumultuous+plague_doctor=Oh, <i>now</i> you deign to speak to me... 
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+tumultuous+plague_doctor=I prefer more intelligent company.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+tumultuous+occultist=Your very aura is a drain.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+tumultuous+occultist=I far prefer my own company to yours.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+tumultuous+jester=Oh, that's a good one. Teehee! No.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+tumultuous+jester=Leave me to my scales.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+tumultuous+leper=Incessant you are, like a buzzing insect.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+tumultuous+leper=A thorn in the paw of a lion...
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+tumultuous+hellion=Always with your moaning!
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+tumultuous+hellion=The fiends outside are better company.
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+tumultuous+runaway=Mayhap someone else will take pity on you. 
bark_act_out_rest_item_hate_block+tumultuous+runaway=I have nothing to say to you.
